year,speech
2013,Mr. President. a year ago today. the Presiding Officer gave one of the classic speeches in American history as a freshman Senator responding to the State of the Union Message. It was a message that was accepted on both sides of the aisle by the people of Virginia and everyone in this country. I wish to remind the Senator what a great public service he rendered last year in giving this speech.
2013,We are going to try to get approved very quicklywe are cleared on this side. we are waiting to have the Republicans clear Governor Shafer to be the Secretary of Agriculture. We would like to get that done in the next little bit. After we do this. it takes the White House a number of hours to get all the paperwork in order so that he can be sworn in. It would be really nice if we could get him to attend the State of the Union Address tonight. This would be extremely good. President Bush has nominated him. This will be the last State of the Union speech the President will give. and it would be good if he had a Secretary of Agriculture there during those proceedings. So as soon as it is cleared by the Republicans. we will clear Governor Shafer to be the Secretary of Agriculture.
2013,Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the previously scheduled cloture vote on the substitute amendment occur at 4:40 p.m. today and that all provisions under the previous order remain in effect. Our staffs have talked. I am confident the Republican leader is aware of this.
2013,Mr. President. this afternoon the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 3 p.m.. with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each. with the time equally divided and controlled between the two leaders. At 3 p.m.. the Senate will resume consideration of the FISA legislation. The time until 4:40 p.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees. with the final 20 minutes equally divided and controlled between the two leaders. with the majority leader controlling the final 10 minutes. At 4:40 p.m.. the Senate will proceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the RockefellerBond substitute amendment. If cloture is not invoked on the substitute. the Senate will then proceed to a second vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the Reid amendment to the underlying bill. As a reminder. there is a 4 p.m. filing deadline for seconddegree amendments. At 9 p.m. tonight. the President will deliver the State of the Union Address to a joint session of Congress. Senators will gather in the Senate Chamber at 8:20 p.m. and then proceed as a body to the Hall of the House of Representatives at 8:30. Senators are encouraged to attend the Secretary of the Senate annual State of the Union supper tonight at 6:30 p.m. in S211.
2013,Mr. President. S. 2557 is at the desk and due for a second reading.
2013,I object to any further proceedings with respect to this bill at this time.
2013,Mr. President. I would say very briefly that someone I have gotten to know over the last number of years died last night at 7 oclockthe leader of the Mormon Church. a man who has been instrumental in the tremendous growth of the church. During his period of time. the church has grown by millions of new people coming into the church. He has been a phenomenal builder. building scores of new temples around the world. As we speak. there is one new church building being built every day. being dedicated every day. That is a lot of construction. I was told last week that the largest single builder of buildings in the United States next to the Federal Government is the LDS Church. the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints. of which this good man was the leader. He is someone who has done some very unique things. He started what is called the Perpetual Education Fund. About half the members of the church are located outside of the United States. Millions of members of the church are located in Mexico. Central and South America. He started what is. as I have indicated. called the Perpetual Education Fund. which is a voluntary contribution made from members of the church to help these people who are coming into the church be educated. As a result. tens of thousands of people are now educated and are now church and community leaders around the world. There is so much more that could be said about this good man who was kind and gentle and epitomized everything that is good in mankind. and certainly on a personal basis I will miss him greatly.
2013,Mr. President. I am not aware of any problems with regard to the nominee for Secretary of Agriculture. and we are running a hotline on this side. I anticipate that it will be cleared shortly. and that will be a confirmation we hopefully can get out of the way at some point this afternoon.
2013,Mr. President. tonight. in keeping with an old custom. the President will speak to Congress and the Nation about the state of the Union. Every President since George Washington has given these periodic updates because the Constitution requires them to do so. While the Constitution makes no similar demands on congressional leaders. there is no doubt that this year the American people are demanding something from us. They are looking for proof that Republicans and Democrats can come together to get a few things done on their behalf. Just 1 week into the session. and we are faced with a crucial test. two issues of vital significance to every American citizen: Will we reauthorize a terrorfighting tool that we know has made us safer. and will we put money back into the taxpayers hands quickly enough for it to have a positive effect on the Nations economy? It is not an exaggeration to say that the choices we make on these issues will show the public whether we are serious about protecting them from harm and serious about protecting their wallets. So the question is this: Will we find a way to work together or will we find a way to get out of it and then blame the other side? We got off to a good start. Last Thursday. millions of Americans were absolutely stunned to turn on their television sets and see the Democratic Speaker of the House and the House Republican leader standing together on a stage behind the Treasury Secretary from the Bush administration and nodding in agreement about an economic growth package they had all worked out among themselves. It was the kind of scene many people have wondered if they would ever see again. For the first time in years. the parties have come together in good faith and responded swiftly to a pressing national concern. They sensed that the Nation was impatient for action. and so they gave up a lot of what they wanted in order to find common ground. House Republicans made major sacrifices. So did House Democrats. Now the Nations attention turns to us. to the Senate. to see if we are capable of the same. Here is our moment to show that we are. A number of Senators have expressed a desire to add to this package tens of billions of dollars in spending on contentious programs. But we dont have the time for ideological debates. In order for this plan to work. Congress needs to act and to act at once. This is not the package. frankly. that I would have put together. In my view. the best way to stimulate the economy would be to lower marginal rates. But neither is it the package my good friend. the majority leader. would have put together. I gather from his public statements he would prefer there be more spending on Government programs. The Speaker and the House Republican leader would also have built a package differently if they had written it on their own. but they put their differences aside because they know we will all get nothing if we are not willing to make some serious sacrifices. The editorial writers at the Washington Post urged us Friday not to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Low- and middleincome taxpayers certainly agree. They are tapping their fingers wondering if we can do it. Americans are also wondering if we can agree on something as fundamental as our national security. and for good reason. We saw some worrisome signs last week that some of our friends were looking for a way out of what would be and could be a good bipartisan achievement on reauthorizing a terrorist surveillance program. They should remember that 3 years ago. following the lead of the 9/11 Commission. Congress came together to create the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. approving the bill that established it by a vote of 89 to 2. The Director of National Intelligence was supposed to be the person who would connect the dots. who would make sure intelligence gaps were closed. who could look across the entire intelligence landscape and tell us about our vulnerabilities before terrorists discovered them on their own. Last year. he did just that. The Director of National Intelligence came to Capitol Hill and asked us to either fix the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that allowed us to monitor foreign terrorists overseas or risk weakening this vital intelligencegathering tool. Our friends across the aisle put off action for months before finally passing a temporary revision right up against the August recess. Then they delayed again last fall. pushing us up against the expiration of the temporary extension. Now they are delaying again. There is only one version of a longterm extension that agrees with the recommendations of the Director of National Intelligence. and that is the pending RockefellerBond substitute bill. This bill was carefully crafted on a strong bipartisan basis and reported out of the Intelligence Committee on a vote of 13 to 2. It is the only version the Director of National Intelligence has approved. It is the only version the President would sign. Therefore. it is the only one that has any chance of becoming law before the current extension expires on Friday of this week. The time to act has long since passed. We need to approve RockefellerBond. and we need to do it this week. Some of our friends on the other side say they will not vote for cloture on Rockefeller/Bond because they could not amend it. No one should be deceived by this complaint. The amendments they want would transform it into a replica of the partisan bill that was reported out of the Judiciary Committee last fall. In other words. allowing amendments would guarantee failure. Some of our friends on the other side say they want a 1month extension. Never mind that we have had 10 months to act already. No one should be deceived by this complaint either. The real reason for the 1month extension. of course. is to give Members who vote in favor of it the political cover they need to vote against Rockefeller/ Bond. This is another clever way to make the bill fail. Some of our friends on the other side say we are wrong to insist that phone carriers who may have cooperated with the Government in tracking terrorists be immune from lawsuits. The implication is that this is some kind of a favor for big business. But this advice is coming from the intelligence community. not politicians. because they know that we could never expect these companiesor any others--to cooperate in the future as long as the threat of a lawsuit looms. Finally. some of our friends accuse us of being scaremongers for urging passage now. But the terrorist threat has not diminished since 9/11. It hasnt expired. The Director of National Intelligence assures us it hasnt. The memory of 9/11 tells us it has not. Attacks in Madrid and London and Bali tell us it has not. And the terrorists themselves tell us it has not. The threat is real. And we cannot let success in preventing another one keep us from staying on offense with all the tools and resources we have. The bottom line is this: by voting for cloture on Rockefeller/Bond. Members will guarantee that this important antiterror tool does not expire. And those who vote against it are voting either to delay its reauthorization or to weaken. not strengthen. our terrorfighting tools. Fixing FISA is within our grasp. Will we come together and embrace the compromise approach that protects us. and doesnt force companies to make a false choice between the good of the firm or the good of the country or will we go the partisan route? It would be a worrisome sign indeed if the first bill Democrats filibuster this year deals with national security. We must resist the mistakes of last year. and act. Last week. we saw the kind of tough compromise thats necessary when lawmakers are more concerned about making a difference than making a political point. Now it is our turn. The second session is young. But the choices we make this week will define us. And in my view. it is a welcome opportunity. Here in the second week of the session we have a chance to show Americans that we can work together on their behalf. to solve problems. to protect their security and protect their wallets. This is a defining moment for the 110th Congress. Lets put the mistakes of last year behind us. Lets show that the U.S. Senate can get the job done. I yield the floor.
2013,"Mr. President. as the majority leader noted. last night Gordon B. Hinckley. the oldest serving president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints in the history. passed away. He was 97 years old. Many might think that in lasting until 97 he passed away as a wasted. wornout man. That is not true. President Hinckley was energetic and enthusiastic and fully engaged within just a day or two of his passing. With my senior colleague Senator HATCH. I have had meetings with him and the other leaders of the church and was always amazed at how well connected he was. He read the papers. He watched the television. He knew what was going on in the world outside the church every bit as much as we did. His memory was phenomenal. There are many people who were 20 to 30 years his junior who could not remember current items of news as well as he could. So it is appropriate we take a moment or two to comment on the stewardship and contribution of this great man at the time of his passing. We do not mourn for him. He has joined his wife. his parents. and those others who have gone before him who may have a little sense of ""Gordon. what took you so long?"" But he stayed at his job and he fulfilled his stewardship in an impressive manner. The mourning we have on this occasion is mourning for ourselves. for the loss we have sustained in seeing this great and good man go on. I have made mention of his energy. I should also mention his enthusiasm. He had a great zest for life. He was always looking forward to the next activity and the next opportunity. Along with his energy and enthusiasm. he was a man of humility and humor. You were never quite sure when he stood at the pulpit to speak if he was going to say something that would put you at ease and make you laugh. because that happened much more often than it did with some others who were a little more serious in their message. His messages were always serious. but they always had that touch of humor. The last message we heard from him. speaking to the entire world in general. and to the church specifically. was his sermon of last October. I am sure he did not know that would be his final sermon to the members of the church. But it started out again with a touch of Hinckley humor. He noted. as he stood to speak. that singers will sing the same song over and over again. as people ask them to perform. orchestras will play the same symphony over and over again. but speakers are always expected to say something new. He said that bothered him a little. as he was going to repeat a sermon he had given before. After we smiled at his early comments. we heard a lecture on anger. He talked about the toxic effects of anger and how we should do our very best. both in our personal lives and in our professional lives. and. if I may. here in the Senate in national dialog. to do away with the sense of anger. I have just returned from the annual session in Davos. Switzerland. where I heard a lot of people who could benefit from that sermon. as there was a lot of anger people had toward other governments and other government officials. I will not in any way attempt to capsulize what President Hinckley had to say about anger. except to demonstrate that this was his benediction prior to his death to the members of his church. telling them not to be angry with their families. not to be angry in their communities. and not to be angry with the world. A former Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ. Paul. spoke in his letter to the Corinthians about the three most important attributes of a Christian: faith. hope. and charity. Gordon B. Hinckley spoke of these same attributes and lived them in his life. But he put them. if you will. in modern terms: optimism. confidence. and love. A sermon telling us not to be angry with our fellow men is a fitting capstone to the stewardship of this man. It is a modern way of saying Pauls term ""charity"" or the pure love of Christ. We shall miss him."
2013,Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that I may speak for about 5 minutes on Gordon B. Hinckley.
2013,"Mr. President. I associate myself with the remarks of my colleague from Utah. Senator BENNETT. He basically stated in very articulate terms how important President Gordon B. Hinckley was. not just to Senator BENNETT and myself. but to people all over the world. I express my deepest empathy. sympathy. and love to the family of Gordon B. Hinckley. I agree with Senator BENNETT. that President Hinckley in dying was happy to go and again be with his beloved eternal companion. Marjorie. whom he missed. who died about 4 years before him. and to be with others he has known here on this Earth. and others he would like to know who helped to make this country the greatest in the world. and many others as well. I extend my deep sympathy to his familya wonderful family. they are terrific people. President Hinckley was as ecumenical as a person could be. He led a worldwide church. the fifth largest church in America. the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints. He basically taught all of us to understand that all religions are good and that we should work together. I dont think there has been a humanitarian mission or a major disaster anywhere in the world where the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saintsnicknamed the Mormonshasnt cooperated with Catholic charities and other Christian charitiesespecially Catholic charitiesto immediately go into action and provide the needed food. clothing. pharmaceuticals. et cetera. all over the world. These two charities have done so much. He made sure our members13 million strong around the worldparticipated in each humanitarian concern. In fact. we have thousands and thousands of humanitarian missionaries all over the world. Many are older people who are retired and are giving 18 months. or even more. of their timeand some lessto be able to bring humanitarian help to people all over the world. This man led that. He was also a great business leader. Imagine. we had a man like this run this very important worldwide church. Senator BENNETT mentioned his sense of humor. You hardly heard a set of remarks by President Hinckley where he didnt very wittily make his points even better than he would have if they were just stern and tough. He was never stern and tough. unless it was essential. He was always kind and loving. He was kind to me. Elaine. my wife. and I personally love him and we are going to miss him very much. He traveled all over the world. I have traveled all over the world. and generally have done it on military planes with military liaisons helping us and carrying our bags. doing everything to make it a reasonable trip. I come back beat every time. In every case. I wanted to kiss the ground when I got back here. He traveled extensively all over the world. almost a million miles. In that regard. I pay tribute to Jon Huntsman. Sr.. who made it possible in his later years for him to have a very good airplane that I think extended his life for a longer period of time for the benefit of mankind all over this world. It was a wonderful thing. He had love for all human beings and he expressed that love not only through his words but also through his actions. I might add that. as Senator REID mentioned. he established the perpetual education fund where members of our faith donate millions of dollars every year to help unfortunate young people in these foreign lands to be able to go to school and raise their educational level so they can become leaders in their own country. and so they can make great contributions. I think it is one of the most inspired things I have ever seen. We have thousands of young men and women who are now leaders in their countriesteachers. doctors. lawyers. and othersall because of the vision of this great man. whom we call a prophet. I might mention that in his travels he dedicated dozens of temples. the most of any president of the church. all over the world. To LDS people those temples are extremely important. We believe marriage is so sacred and it is for all eternity. not just this life. Frankly. we try to live that way. Many do. These temples are extremely important to us. He went all over the world doing it. I can truthfully say this is a man I loved. He was a profound influence on Senator BENNETT. me. and millions of others. He was a man who got along with leaders of other faiths. He taught us we must respect everybody. Today I add my voice to those of 13 million other members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints in bidding farewell to our beloved prophet. President Gordon Bitner Hinckley. His death late yesterday in his home in Salt Lake City has reminded us that all good things must come to an end. It is a sad day for all Utahns. We have lost our friend. our leader. and our fellow servant. President Hinckley lived great. and he died great in the eyes of God and his people. leaving behind him a fame and a name which will be known for generations to come. In our effort to follow in President Hinckleys footsteps. Latterday Saints found they had to lengthen their stride to keep up with him. Even into the sunset of his life. President Hinckley was indefatigable. He set a vigorous pace. traveling the world and sharing his message of service. love. and compassion with millions of all faiths. Everywhere our prophet traveled. he succored the weak. lifted the hands which hung down. and strengthened the feeble knees. When I think of the blessing President Hinckley was to those around him. I am reminded of the words from the great Mormon hymn. ""Every day some burden lifted. every day some heart to cheer. every day some hope the brighter. blessed honored pioneer."" President Hinckley was born to humble surroundings on June 23. 1910. in Salt Lake City. UT. He attended public schools. and graduated with a bachelors of arts from the University of Utah. His first job was as a newspaper carrier for Utahs Deseret News. This modest start with a newspaper was a prelude of things to come. President Hinckley became the most media savvy leader the LDS Church has ever known. sharing his warmth and spirit with countless reporters. cultivating great friendships with notables like Larry King and Mike Wallace. Wallace once described President Hinckley as ""a man I admire and I love really. because hes just an extraordinary guy."" As many Latterday Saints do. Gordon B. Hinckley served a mission for the church while he was young. President Hinckley served in Great Britain in the 1930s. sharing the gospels message of peace and hope during a time of great political and economic turmoil. Discouraged by the lack of receptivity he found among the Britons. he confided his dismay to his father. who instructed the young Gordon to ""forget himself and go to work."" Young Gordon did. both in Great Britain and in the 70 years of service that followed. His love of God fueled his love of country. President Hinckley carried the torch of patriotism. and the spirit of America burned in his heart. He once said. ""I love America for [its] great constitutional strength. for the dedication of its people to the peace and the prosperity of the entire earth. I love America for the tremendous genius of its scientists. its laboratories. its universities. its researchers. and the tens of thousands of facilities devoted to the improvement of human health and comfort. to the extension of life. to better communication and transportation. Its great throbbing and thriving industries have blessed the entire world. The standard of living of its people has been the envy of the entire Earth. Its farmlands have yielded an abundance undreamed of by most people of the Earth. The entrepreneurial environment in which has grown its industry has been the envy of and model for many other nations."" President Hinckleys patriotism inspired him to great acts of civic service. in addition to his church duties. He was a chairman or board member of many businesses and educational entities. He received honorary doctorates from five colleges and universities. the Distinguished Service Award from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. the Silver Buffalo Award from the Boy Scouts of America. and special recognition for his contributions to tolerance from the National Conference of Christians and Jews. President Hinckleys ministry earned him national prominence. In 2004. President George W. Bush awarded our prophet with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. the Nations highest civil award. President Hinckley was one of the spiritual leaders President Bush invited to the White House following the September 11 attacks. It was a great honor. both for him and our faith. that the President invited him to that gathering. A few months later. on the eve of the Winter Olympics in 2002. President Bush said. ""President Hinckley represents a great religion. he is a strong part of the American scene."" But President Hinckley never let his love of the United States obscure his vision for the rest of the world. Prior to becoming the LDS president in 1995. Hinckley supervised the churchs organization in Asia. Europe. and South America. During his tenure. the number of members living inside North America was surpassed by those living outside of it. The nations of the Earth heard his voice and he brought them a knowledge of the truth by the wonderful testimony which he bore. As president. he administered to both the ecclesiastical and temporal needs of the church. whose 13 million members are spread over some 160 nations and territories. President Hinckley lifted his voice on every continent. in cities large and small. from north to south and east to west across this broad world. One global vision President Hinckley had for the LDS Church was a perpetual education fund. whereby members in wealthier nations could donate to the education of those in developing nations. thereby empowering them to help themselves and strengthening the infrastructure in struggling parts of the world. particularly Latin America. When he became president of the church in 1995. the church had only 47 temples. our special meeting houses such as the magnificent one in nearby Kensington. MD. Thanks to President Hinckleys vision of expansion. today there are 124 in operation. and 12 more are under construction. One of his first messages upon becoming our prophet in 1995 was a proclamation to the world. declaring the divine nature of the family unit and providing direction on how to nurture strong family relationships. There is no greater duty or privilege among the Latterday Saints than to serve our families. President Hinckley admirably demonstrated that service as a grandfather. father. and husband to his eternal companion. Marjorie. who walked side by side with him for twothirds of a century. Now he and Marjorie are walking together in the fields of paradise. enjoying a richly deserved peace in the Lord. I am sure at this time he would remind us that death is the great equalizer. No matter what a man or woman may accomplish in this life. this final inevitability is waiting for them. Shortly before his own passing. perhaps seeing the end was nigh. President Hinckley told church members. ""A man must get his satisfaction from his work each day. must recognize that his family may remember him. that he may count with the Lord. but beyond that. small will be his monument among the coming generations."" Our heads are bowed now. as we bid him farewell. Gordon Bitner Hinckley joins the ranks of departed prophets. on whose shoulders he stood and in whose mighty company he can now proudly mingle. God be with you. our friend. till we. meet again. I have to say. he stood for everything that was good. and I love him. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum."
2013,Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.
2013,Mr. President. I have sought recognition to speak briefly in opposition to the motion to invoke cloture. The amendment which I have filed goes to the heart of the issue on removing liability from the telephone companies to impose retroactive immunity. The amendment which I have filed and has been discussed on the floor of the Senate would substitute the Government for the party defendant. where the Government would have the same defensesno more. no less. For example. the telephone companies do not have the defense of governmental immunity. and the Government. when substituted. would not have the defense of governmental immunity. The telephone companies can plead state secrets to foreclose the litigation. and when the Government would be substituted. for example. the Government could assert the doctrine of state secrets in order to foreclose the litigation. If the motion to invoke cloture is granted. I am advised by the Parliamentarian my amendment would not be germane and. therefore. would be stricken. We went through a long session last year where the argument was made. repeatedly and persuasively. not to invoke cloturethe argument advanced on this side of the aislein order to give Members on this side of the aisle an opportunity to propose their amendments. Now we have the first situation sought to be applied. and it is my hope this body will reject the cloture motion. There has been very little time spent on this very important subject in this body. and when you have a matter of the importance of retroactive immunity. where you are going to shut off the courts of the United States from hearing cases that are already pending. there ought to be time for consideration of an amendment such as the one Senator WHITEHOUSE and I have offered to substitute the U.S. Government. The purpose of our amendment is to comport with the basic constitutional provision of separation of powers. which is the cornerstone of the Constitution. and we have found. regrettably. it has been inadequate to have congressional supervision. congressional oversight. because of its ineffectiveness. For example. when the Judiciary Committee seeks to obtain records on the destruction of CIA tapes. you find the administration resisting and the inevitable argument of politics. When the court issues an order. as the Federal Court did last week for a report on the destruction of documents. seeking to find out what happened on the destruction of the CIA documents. the court cant be charged with politics. We find in Rasul. and in other litigation matters. the judicial branch has been effective in maintaining the separation of power. One further comment. It is a surprise to me that the amendment which I have offered with Senator WHITEHOUSE has been ruled nongermane. I took a look at Websters International Dictionary and germane is defined as: closely or significantly related. relevant. pertinent. closely akin. I consulted with a Parliamentarian and asked why our amendment was ruled as nongermane. and the answer given was because there was no specific statement of the underlying bill on governmental liability. In pursuing the issue with the Parliamentarian. I then said: I am going to seek to change the rules. It seems to me peculiar. if not absurd. that my amendment. the SpecterWhitehouse amendment. would not be germane under the common meaning of the English language. I said: Suppose we change the rules to provide that it was relevant? And the answer I got. and I dont want to misquote anybody. was that: Yes. that would stand the test of relevancy. As he put it. a more permissive standard. So then I checked the definition of relevant in Websters International Dictionary. and it says: Bearing upon or connected with the matter in hand. to the purpose. pertinent. raise. lift up. syn applicable. germane. appropriate. suitable. fitting. Well. the key part about the definition of relevant is that one of the synonyms is germane. just as one of the synonyms of germane is relevant. Now. it is a loss to me. I have been here a while. and I have had a hard time understanding the ruling of what is germane. and I have never seen one as close to the core point as putting the Government as a substitute for the telephone companies. but somehow it is not germane. So I wish to put my colleagues on notice that I intend to try to change the rules. I cant see why one is necessary when Websters has germane as a substitute for relevant and relevant as a substitute for germane. If the Parliamentarian thinks that relevant is OK. it is. again. hard for me to see why germane is not. A little surprising.
2013,Mr. President. will the Senator yield for question? I dont want to interrupt his comments.
2013,I will.
2013,Mr. President. morning session is up at 3. and I am scheduled for 15 minutes. I might ask to extend the time. I dont know how much time the Senator is going to use. but I want to make certain I have the opportunity that was previously ordered. for 15 minutes on this side.
2013,Mr. President. how much additional time does the Senator from Pennsylvania need?
2013,Less than a minute.
2013,Let me ask unanimous consent that we extend by 5 minutes the time for morning business so it terminates at 3:05.
2013,I thank my colleague for his courtesy.
2013,I thank the distinguished Senator from North Dakota. Well. I have made my argument. I think it is important to have a ruling. a vote by this body on whether we are going to apply retroactive immunity to the telephone companies. I said on the floor last week that if my amendment is not adopted. I will support retroactive immunity. I think it is a bad practice. but I think. as bad as that practice is. it would be worse to cut off the information which our intelligence community thinks we need. I think it is not advisable. And when we have a method of having both objectives. that is to have the Government have access to the information and at the same time not impose the cutting off of the judicial system for checks and balances. I think that ought to be adopted. And further. a final comment on the hardtounderstand definition of germane. The dictionary defines it as being relevant. and the dictionary defines relevant as being germane. with the Parliamentarian giving a supplemental opinion that if the standard was relevance. it would be appropriate to have the amendment. I thank the Chair. and I yield the floor.
2013,Mr. President. tonight we will hear from the President in his annual State of the Union Address. I know the President is expected to talk a great deal about the economy and the need for an economic stimulus package. I wanted to talk for a moment about this because I think it is important for us to understand what is happening to our economy. I know there are some who think the field of economics is some field with precision and elegance and that we are dealing with the ship of state. If we can find our way to the engine room and find all the knobs and gauges and valves and levers and turn them the right way. such as providing an investment credit and bonus depreciation. that somehow we will get this ship of state moving again. Of course. that is not what is at stake at all. There isnt an engine room with knobs and valves and gauges. This is the field of economics. which I have said previously is a lot like psychology pumped up with helium. So we talk a lot about knowing what is going on. The fact is we are going to now do a stimulus package because there is a notion that there is a problem with the economy. Well. there is more than a problem. there is a very serious problem with this economy. Take a look at the stock market. which is a barometer of confidenceup and down similar to a yoyomostly down. The housing market has cratered. with construction of new homes and apartments in 2007 down 25 percent from the prior year. That is one of the giant job engines in our economythe housing market. The unemployment rate has jumped. with some 1.4 million workers without a job for 27 months or longer. The trade deficit recently hit a 14month high. Oil prices are still way up. Retail sales are their worst in years. So we have a very serious problem. Now. the Federal Reserve Board took bold action last week and that is unusual for the Federal Reserve Board. They all wear gray suits and wirerimmed glasses and seldom do anything that is very bold. but last week they did. They cut interest rates by threequarters of 1 percent. So the expectation is that because the Fed is taking that action and seems to be very concerned about the economy. that we should take a look at our fiscal policy. so there is talk about a stimulus. Frankly. I think a stimulus package is fine. I dont think it does all that much. But the absence of doing something on the Senate side of Congress would send the wrong signal. Psychologically. it is important we work on a stimulus. We are talking about a stimulus that is probably 1 percent of our economy. so it is not exactly going to jump start the American economy. In addition. if all we do is a stimulus package and we continue to ignore the fundamentals. the things that are structurally wrong in this economy. the things that have not just caused the economy to be in some trouble but caused the American people and people all around the world to look at us and say: You know something. you are off track. You are not addressing the things that matter. and this is unsustainable. If we dont do something to address those things. we will not be addressing the basic problem of our economy. So let me talk about that. No. 1. a fiscal policy. A reckless fiscal policy. I mean. in recent years. think of it. This administration inherited a large budget surplus. Then we got hit with a recession. a war in Afghanistan. a war in Iraq. a war on terrorismand a whole series of eventsincluding Hurricane Katrina. Many of us said to the President: Dont propose we spend surpluses that dont yet exist. Let us be conservative. He said: Katy bar the door. let us have big tax cuts and most of it for the wealthy. and he pushed it through Congress. Now. I didnt push for it. he did. and we ran up a huge deficit because of all these unexpected circumstances we were confronted with. So now. in recent years. we have sent soldiers off to war. and the President says to Congress: We are sending soldiers to go fight. but we dont intend to pay for it. I want the Congress to provide emergency spending in order to pay for that. and we will add it to the debt. Last year. he asked Congress for $196 billion for the current fiscal year. That is $16 billion a month. $4 billion a week. none of it paid for. and all of it added to the debt. As if to say to the soldiers: You go fight. and when you come home. we will have you and your kids pay the bills. That is a fiscal policy that is completely off balance. We are going to borrow about $600 billion this year. That is how much will be added to the debt. I know that is not what they say the deficit is. They say the deficit is lower because. among other things. they are taking all the Social Security surplus from the trust funds and using it to show a lower deficit. We are going to borrow about $600 billion a year to sustain the budget policies of this administration. Add to that a $700 billion to $800 billion a year trade deficit. $2 billion a day every single day. and you are talking about a combined red ink in our budget and trade policies of some $1.3 trillion. That is almost 10 percent of the American economy. Think of that. That is unsustainable. Now. add to a reckless fiscal policy and a trade policy in which we are hemorrhaging red ink and exporting American jobs. regulators who were asleep on the jobpeople who came to Government but didnt want to regulateand the subprime loan scandal occurred right under their noses. We all heard the advertisements. When you turned on the television. you heard the ads. It couldnt have escaped the notice of the regulators. surely. The ads said: Have you been bankrupt? Do you have trouble getting credit? Have you been missing your house payments? Come to us. We have a loan for you. We will give you a new home mortgage. And so they did. with a teaser rate at 2 percent and unbelievable circumstances. Everybody was making lots of money. The brokers were making millions. the mortgage banks were making a lot of money. and then they were packing these mortgage loans. the good ones. with the bad ones. just like they used to pack sausage with meat and sawdust. They would use the sawdust as filler back in the old days. Well. during unregulated times. just like packing sawdust into sausages. what these folks did is. they took good loans and bad loans. packaged them up. They sliced them up. then they securitized them. and sent them out. sold them. and everybody was happy and everybody was fat and everybody was making a lot of money. until it all came home to roost. A whole lot of folks could not make housing payments. So what we found with the subprime loan scandal is 2.2 million families with subprime loans will lose their homes to foreclosure. 7.2 million with subprime mortgages have an outstanding mortgage value of $1.3 trillion. And when those interest rates reset. a whole lot of them will not be able to pay the bills to keep their homes. All of this happened under the nose of regulators who came to Government not wanting to regulate. And it caused severe damage to our country. Now. add to that a reckless fiscal policy. a trade deficit in which we are hemorrhaging in red ink and shipping jobs overseas and a scandal in the home mortgage industry that caused enormous damage to our country. made a lot of folks rich in the short term. and victimized a lot of others. Add to that the unbelievable speculation that is going on in hedge funds. most all of it outside of the view of regulators. Hedge funds are about $1.2 to $1.5 trillion in value. but that does not describe their importance to the economy. They are heavily leveraged. That $1.2 to $1.5 trillion of hedge funds is engaged in onehalf of all of the trades every day on the New York Stock Exchange. They are engaged in. among other things. credit default swaps. There is something called credit default swaps. derivatives. with notional values of $43 trillion. There is so much unbelievable speculation with dramatic amounts of leverage in hedge funds and derivatives that it is scary. Nobody knows what is going on because it is outside the view of regulators. That is the way they want to keep it. We will talk about stimulus. we will talk about shortterm measures. But if we do not deal with this issue of a fiscal policy that is way off track. a trade policy that is an abject failure. regulators who have no interest in regulating. scandals will develop and mature right under their noses. this country is not going to recover. Our economy is not going to thrive and grow. It is fine to do a stimulus package of 1 percent of GDP. I do not object to that. We will borrow the money from China. likely. to do it. perhaps put some money in the hands of people who will go to WalMart and buy goods from China. for all I know. But. psychologically. I think it is fine to create a fiscal policy initiative that compliments what they are doing at the Fed with monetary policy. But that will not solve the underlying problems in our economy. We have deep abiding problems in fiscal policy. trade policy. and regulatory failures. This Congress and this President have a responsibility to address them. Talking about stimulus. and just talking about stimulus. means we have not addressed that which moves this ship of state forward in the future. creating expansion opportunities and jobs and economic health. The only way we do that is to stare truth in the eye and understand what is causing the problems in the country and how to fix it. There is an old saying on Wall Street I was told by a friend: You cannot tell who is swimming naked until the tide goes out. Well. the tide has gone out. and now we are going to see some sights that are not very pretty. It has to do with speculation and a whole series of things that we have to correct. And my hope is. starting this evening at the State of the Union Address and following that. at last long last. we might see a President and a Congress work together to face the truth about fiscal policy. trade policy. and inept regulation that has put this country in significant difficulty and trouble. We need not have a future that manifests that trouble forever. If we take bold action and courageous action to understand what is wrong and what the menu of items are that we need to go to fix it. I think we can have a much better and brighter economic future in this country. I want to be a part of that work. and I know many of my colleagues do as well. So lets hope the first step to do that begins this evening at the joint session of the Congress at the State of the Union Address.
2013,Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session. that the Agriculture Committee be discharged of PN 1112. the nomination of Ed Schafer. to be Secretary of Agriculture. that the Senate proceed to the nomination. that the nomination be confirmed. and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table. that any statements relating to the nomination be printed in the RECORD. the President be immediately notified of the Senates action. and the Senate return to legislative session. My understanding is this was cleared on both sides. I am particularly proud to make this request. Former Governor Schafer is a distinguished former Governor from our State. It is a great honor for our State to have him nominated.
2013,Reserving the right to object. and I will not object. I wish to join with the Senator from North Dakota. who is doing a fine thing. We appreciate the support on both sides of the aisle. We obviously need a good and strong Secretary of Agriculture. and we are pleased to see this body move forward. I do not object. I thank the sponsors.
2013,Mr. President. might I also say as we ask for the consent that my colleague. Senator CONRAD. worked very hard to accomplish this in the Agriculture Committee. He joins me as well.
2013,Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that I have at least 10 minutes to give my remarks on FISA.
2013,"Mr. President. I have been to this floor on numerous occasions to aggressively support the immunity provisions of the FISA modernization bill. I cannot understate my passion for this issue. I am of the firm belief that the lawsuits facing the telecom providers constitute a grave threat to national security. The potential risks from inadvertent disclosure of classified information cannot be understated. The potential damage to our intelligence sources and methods from allowing these lawsuits to go forward is substantial. Unfortunately. the more we delay this legislation. the more likely it is that our sensitive intelligence methods will be exposed. and not just exposed to the American people but to alQaida and thousands of other terrorists and enemies around the world. Remember. the very point of these lawsuits is to prove plaintiffs claims by disclosing classified information through the discovery process. Lets think about this. Do we really want any person to be able to make accusations that are utter hearsay and then be given the ability to jeopardize the intelligence communitys sources and methods by demanding discovery during frivolous litigation? We simply cannot do this. We should never reveal our intelligence agencies technical capabilities. who they work with. who they target. or what their strengths and weaknesses are. We on the Intelligence Committees have that assignment because we are expected to honor the classified nature of those matters. The reasons should be obvious to all of us. Here is an example that illustrates this point: If criminals are running drugs northbound along 195. they may have an idea that they will encounter police checkpoints. But they need to transport the drugs. so they will balance this risk. But what if they know for sure there is a checkpoint in a specific State? What if they then find out the checkpoint is at a specific mile marker? Will they change their routes and methods? You better believe they will. They are not stupid and neither is alQaida. Does it really make sense for us to broadcast across the globe. over the Internet. how we work? Do we want to replace the uncertainty of how we track terrorists with established fact? Confirmations or denials of the allegations in the lawsuits will certainly reveal certain intelligence agencies sources and methods. Even when the proceedings are in camera or ex parte. this risk is still apparent. I cannot stress this point enough: The identity of any company that may or may not have cooperated with the Government with the terrorist surveillance program is highly classified. Accusations and hearsay do not confirm any relationship. The very activities these cases seek to disclose could reveal whether a company has or hasnt assisted the Government. In addition. any verdict in the case would likely provide the same type of information. and replacing the Government for these companies in the litigation does not solve the problem. Our enemies have tough decisions to make regarding how they communicate. They cannot stay silent forever. and they have to weigh the need to communicate against the chances that their communications are intercepted. We know they are carefully watching us and following every proceeding to see how our Government collects information. If they think they see a weakness in our collection capabilities. they will certainly try to take advantage of it. Make no mistake. alQaida and the other terrorist organizations would benefit tremendously from learning the identity of any company that assisted the Government following the attacks of 9/11. A few of my colleagues and many in the outside media have highlighted accusations from a former telecom employee. His name is Mark Klein. Mr. Klein claims he has proof that computers diverted domestic electronic communications from a phone company directly to the NSA. the National Security Agency. In fact. his accusations play a major role in one of the lawsuits currently facing a telecom provider. It is important to note the Government chose not to classify Kleins declarations or exhibits in one of the lawsuits. The Government could have. but it didnt. So Kleins court documents are public. Due to the ongoing litigation. I do not want to speak directly to his claims. but I will highlight a statement that was made by an official representing the Government during a court proceeding in one of the lawsuits against a telecom provider. This statement was from the Assistant Attorney General on June 23. 2006. in front of Judge Vaughn Walker. Here is what was said about the decision not to classify Kleins declarations. This is the Government statement regarding Mark Klein: we have not asserted a privilege over the Klein declarations or exhibits. Mr. Klein and Marcus never had access to any of the relevant classified information here. and with all respect to them. through no fault or failure of their own. they dont know anything. I cannot understate the importance of this quote as it has never been mentioned during this debate. No further commentary on it is needed. but I think its meaning is extremely important when Senators and the public weigh the relevancy and reliability of Kleins accusations. I am particularly hopeful that three of my distinguished colleagues who have highlighted Kleins claims on this floor are aware of these statements from the Government. I hope we all realize Kleins accusations highlight only one side of the story. I also want to draw attention to another claim repeatedly made on this floor: the false declaration that the immunity provision in this bill will ""close the courthouse door."" These claims seek to convey the false impression that the immunity provision in this bill will halt all litigation relating to the terrorist surveillance program. or TSP. This is absolutely false. There are no fewer than seven lawsuits currently pending against Government officials that are related to the TSP. The immunity provision in this bill will notI repeat that. will notaffect any of those cases. These cases are completely unaffected by the immunity provision in this bill. Here are the cases. AlHaramain Islamic Foundation. Inc. v. George W. Bush. ACLU v. National Security Agency. Center for Constitutional Rights v. George W. Bush. Guzzi v. George W. Bush. Henderson v. Keith Alexander. Shubert v. George W. Bush. Tooley v. George W. Bush. Finally. it is imperative for us to understand national security is greatly dependent on the cooperation of telecom providers. We cannot do it by ourselves. Yet many foreign governments are in quite the opposite situation. one which gives them an advantage in certain electronic interceptions. Many foreign telecoms are run by the respective host government. Many others have government officials with controlling authority. These countries do not have to worry about telecom cooperation. They can simply force the telecoms to comply. We have chosen not to have that system in our great Nation. Rather. we rely on the voluntary assistance of telecommunication providers. When these companies are asked to assist the intelligence community based on a program authorized by the President and based on assurances from the highest levels of Government that the program has been determined to be lawful. they should be able to rely on these representations. For those who argue we need a compromise. let me be clear: We already have a compromise. The Government wanted more than what is represented in this bill. and they did not get it. The chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence stated the following in the Intelligence Committee report: The [Intelligence] Committee did not endorse the immunity provision lightly. It was the informed judgment of the Committee after months in which we carefully reviewed the facts in the matter. The Committee reached the conclusion that the immunity remedy was appropriate in this case after holding numerous hearings and briefings on the subject and conducting thorough examination of the letters sent by the U.S. Government to the telecommunications companies. The immunity provisions in this bill are limited in scope. Not everyone is going to be happy with them. and that is the whole point. I. for one. wanted to see more protection for companies and Government officials in this bill. but I am willing to accept the compromise. and my colleagues should be willing to do the same. We are not all getting what we want. We are getting what the public has to havewhat the public needs. We have been working on legislation to modernize FISA since at least April of 2007. I am extremely proud of the bipartisan efforts that led to this bill in the Intelligence Committee where all of the investigations were made. where the intelligence was protected. We found a balance. Lets show the confidence and resolve to vote on this compromise. not back away from it. I will support cloture on the RockefellerBond substitute amendment. and I urge my colleagues to do the same. In that regard. I pray that my colleagues will listen to the distinguished ranking member of the Intelligence Committee. Senator BOND. who has played a significantly proper and important role in helping to get this bill through the committee and to the Senate floor. This is a major bill of protection for our country. and I attribute much of the success of it to Senator ROCKEFELLER. the chairman of the committee. and Senator BOND. the ranking member. both of whom have been sterling leaders on this issue. I hope it is not true that anybody in this body will support some of the amendments that may be brought to the Senate floor because we have looked at this issue frontwards. backwards. all over the place. We have examined it. We spent many months on this subject in the Intelligence Committee. That should not be ignored. It passed the Intelligence Committee 13 to 2 compared to the substitute we defeated with cloture that was 10 to 9 in the Judiciary Committee. Mr. President. I ask that we support cloture on this bill."
2013,Mr. President. I believe our time on this side has expired. I thank my colleague from Utah. who is a valued member of the Intelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee. truly a real authority in this area. When he speaks. he speaks from not only a great deal of knowledge but study. We are grateful for his assistance. He is a tremendous asset to this body in many ways but none more so than on the Intelligence Committee.
2013,"Mr. President. I rise to oppose the vote to invoke cloture on the FISA bill. I have no choice but to vote against cloture in order to preserve the rights of my colleagues to have their amendments to this landmark legislation considered. It has been a very weird process. The FISA legislation before the Senate has been taken. in effect. hostage. In a transparent attempt to score political points off of national security issues. the White House has decided. once again. that scaring the American people with unfounded and manipulative claims is in order. The Presidents decision to use the FISA bill in a game of chicken represents a new low. even by Washington standards. The administrations practice of placing politics above national security when it serves the polldriven agenda of its advisers has become an addiction in this White House. Even when the Senate is on the verge of producing much needed national security legislation that the President supports and wants. the addictive political cravings that have coursed through the administrations body for the past 7 years kick in once again. As is often the case. addictions produce behavior that is both irrational. and in this case more. unfortunately. selfdestructive. In this case. the White House has misguidedly calculated that it is worth jeopardizing passage of a bill which they support. which strengthens the collection of foreign intelligence. in order to obtain a shortterm political objective. The White House is gambling with the safety of Americans and the continued cooperation of companies that we rely on to aid in our efforts to protect our country. It is time for the Senate to take a stand and reject these reprehensible tactics. The Senate Intelligence Committee took enormous care to craft legislation that would give our intelligence community greater latitude to conduct surveillance of foreign targets while not compromising the constitutional and statutory protections afforded to Americans both here and overseas. Senator KIT BOND and I worked extremely closely on that. as we did. as I will explain. with many others. This was a painstaking process. It went over many months. but it ultimately produced this balanced legislation that the vice chairman and the committee and I sought. It is a solid bill. And I believe with some limited changes it can be a better bill. limited changes. I might add. that will in no way impede or in any way intrude into the collection of the intelligence we need. Every step of the way during the process of producing this bill gave me great satisfaction. We worked in a consultive way with the administration. These discussions have always been in good faith. We have talked as professionals. trying to work out a hard problem to which most people do not pay a lot of attention but which has enormous consequences for our country. and we have done it in good faith. the very good faith that the actions of the White House now threaten to unravel. From when the Intelligence Committee called on the administration to propose a FISA modernization bill last springthe vice chairman and I did thatto the many committee hearings that followed. to sectionbysection. linebyline. wordbyword consultations too numerous to count that we had with the lawyers and intelligence experts in the Justice Department. from the National Security Agency. from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to outside experts. we have worked in good faith with the administration to achieve. against. frankly. considerable odds. the unthinkable. to wit: a bipartisan bill dealing with the issues of profound complexity that has the endorsement of not only the President but also of the intelligence community professionals who will be the ones who carry out this surveillance. They want this bill. The committee included in its FISA bill a narrowly crafted provision that would provide immunity for telecommunications companies that participated in the Presidents warrantless surveillance program after September 11 and until the program was placed under court authorization last January. We rejected the administrations proposed openended language in defining very tailored immunity language. We rejected their openended language to extend immunity to Government officials. That was taken out. So if there was wrongdoing somewhere. do not make the assumption automatically. without thinking this thing through deeply. that it came from a private sector entity as opposed to public officials. I realize this is a controversial matter with many of my colleagues. particularly on my side of the aisle. but I reject the games that are being played on both sides: by those Senators who are prepared to filibuster the bill due to their opposition to narrow immunity. and the administrations wishes to prevent the Senate from considering any alternative amendments to the immunity provision. We should debate the liability issue fully. and the Senate should be allowed to consider alternative amendments. And I say this. and I think the vice chairman would agree with me. out of an abundance of confidence that the committee position will ultimately be sustained by the Senate in the end. The majority leader has made prompt passage of the FISA bill the top priority for the Senate. He pushed off other subjects so that it could be conferenced with the House and eventually be placed on the Presidents desk for his signature. If allowed. the Senate can complete action on the FISA bill in a matter of a few days. Unlike many bills the Senate considers where the number of amendments that can be disposed of can approach or exceed 100 or 150 or 175. passage of the FISA bill will probably involve relatively modest numbers of amendments and a very manageable number of amendments. I estimate that number would be somewhere in the 12to15 amendment range. probably fewer. Some of these amendments I would support as needed as improvements to the bill of the committee. the Intelligence Committee. Many I would oppose because of my concern that it would undo the careful balance we achieved in the underlying Committee bill. This is a stitched piece of work between collection of intelligence for the national security and the rights and privacy of individuals. I will oppose anything that undoes that balance. The amendments that are likely to pass with a majority vote. at least in my view. such as the Feinstein exclusivity and Cardin sunset amendments. are further refinements of provisions already in the Intelligence Committee bill. and they in no way bear on the collection of intelligence authorities sought and provided by our bill. Those that would undercut these authorities to be able to do collection. I am confident. would go down to defeat. But the Republican leadership. under orders from the White House. objected to these amendments being considered and voted on. and the bill passed before the February 1 expiration of the temporary and flawed Protect America Act passed last August. So that is where we are going to be unless we can resolve this in the Senate. which we could do by the end of the week. Why? Why has the White House used obstructionist tactics to prevent the Senate from passing a FISA bill that it wants. that it has declared acceptable? The President says he wants the Intelligence Committee bill passed as soon as possible. He said as recently as last Friday that he understands there may be some limited number of changes that will be needed to make the bill stronger. Others. including Minority Leader MCCONNELL and Vice Chairman BOND. also have acknowledged the reality that amendments will have to be brought up and voted on before the Senate can pass the bill. That is. after all. the way of the Senate. Why. then. are they preventing the Senate from voting on the limited number of amendments before us and passing the bill. a bill that they want? Why? A bill that has everything to do with the future of our country. our national security. and a bill which we will not soon come to again if we dont achieve success in the coming days. The majority leader has repeatedly offered the proposal to extend the February 1 expiration date in the current stopgap law 30 days to allow sufficient time to complete our work on the legislation. But each time this 30day extension consent request was sought. it was killed by the Republican leadership under orders from the White House. Why in the world would a temporary extension be objectionable to a President who is on record as saying he doesnt want the current law to expire without a more lasting FISA modernization bill in place? Yet. in one of the most astounding ""Alice in Wonderland"" moments I have ever witnessed in my time in the Senate. the White House announced last week that the President would veto a 30day extension of the current foreign collection authorities passed by Congress. So lets recap. The President wants the FISA bill passed by the Senate. but he has sent the decree down to the Republican leadership that they are to prevent its prompt passage. Well. prompt passage we have to have. The President does not want the current 6month Protect America Act to expire this Friday. He does not want that to happen. But he has stated he will veto any extension and thereby ensure that it will expire. What more evidence is needed to demonstrate the irrational and selfdestructive political addiction that drives this White House? Doesnt drive the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee. I guarantee that. Under the tortured logic of protecting America against terrorism. the White House has decided to exercise. frankly. its own form of political terrorism and has taken the FISA bill hostage. From the beginning. the administration has demonstrated a deepseated contempt for the role of Congress in authorizing and monitoring intelligence activities. Whether it is the National Security Agencys warrantless surveillance program or the Central Intelligence Agencys secret detention and interrogation program. the White House for over 5 years walled off the Congress and the courts from conducting the sort of meaningful oversight and checks and balances that are essential to making sure our intelligence programs are on sound legal operational footing. To make matters worse. the administration has successfully used objections and delaying tactics over the past 3 years to keep the intelligence authorization bill from being passed and signed into law. It is this flawed policy of Executive Branch unilateralism that has created the mess we are now dealing with. There is no possible way I can overstate the importance of this bill. But it is hard to explain. Everybody can grasp on to the immunity issue. leap to one side or the other. often without sufficient thought. But the bill as a whole. meshed together as a whole like an Appalachian quilt. is a thing of beauty. can be improved. and should be passed. Nevertheless. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Republican cloture motion on the FISA bill so that we can reassert something called the role of Congress that we must play on these and other important national security matters. Oversight is what we do. We dont write a lot of bills in the Intelligence Committee. but we do oversight. But it is not welcome in the current atmosphere. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Republican cloture motion so that we can consider on their merits the limited. manageable number of amendments to the bill and. in the process. push bipartisan FISA reform across the finish line. I know Vice Chairman BOND and others are ready to get back to business and start disposing of amendments. I feel confident that he and I. as managers of this bill. will work closely. as we have in the committee. to ensure that we do no unintended harm to this bill in the matters of collection of intelligence or any other unbalancing of this Appalachian craftwork. There is still time for the Senate to work its way on the FISA bill and pass it before the weeks end. I hope we do so. I yield the floor."
2013,Mr. President. it is my understanding that this side has 40 minutes of debate. is that correct?
2013,Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that that be divided. that I be allocated 15 minutes and that I be notified when my 15 minutes is up. that at the appropriate time. the Senator from Texas be recognized for 15 minutes. and then. after intervening discussion from the other side. the Senator from Georgia. Mr. CHAMBLISS. be recognized for 5 minutes. I would reserve the remainder of the time for closing argument.
2013,"I thank the Chair. Mr. President. we began consideration of this bill on December 17. the FISA Amendments Act of 2007. As my friend the chairman said. it was passed by the Senate Intelligence Committee with overwhelming bipartisan support. It has garnered the support of the Director of National Intelligence. and I believe it is the way forward. I was a bit amused to hear my friend say that the FISA bill was being taken hostage. they were scoring political points. I havent heard from the White House anything other than they want to have this bill passed. We have sought to protect the rights of Republican Members on the minority side. We have suggested that this bill is so controversial. as all intelligence bills are. that amendments be subjected to a 60vote majority. The simple fact is. we could pass perhaps a number of amendments that could destroy the structure of the bill we have presented and put us in the position where it would not get the 60 votes needed to pass. My suggestion is that we move forward accepting some amendments. There are amendments on both sides. I agree with the chairman. that can be accepted. Maybe we could even accept them without a vote or accept votes on others at a simple majority. a 51vote majority. and then on certain controversial ones. we may have to have 60 votes. But we are ready to move forward. We are not the ones who have held up this bill. Very briefly. in April. the Director of National Intelligence. Admiral McConnelland I will refer to him as the DNIsent a bill to the Senate Intelligence Committee and said FISA is out of date. It has to be updated. He came before us and testified in May. I asked him to do something. Nothing happened. He came before the full Senate. actually. in closed session. all Senators invited. that was in June. He explained how urgent it was and how we were being left deaf and blind to communications of terrorists. Nothing happened. It was at the end of that session. going into the August recess. that he proposed a temporary shortened version of FISA which became the Protect America Act. I was pleased to support that in the Senate. It passed the House and was signed. We came back in September. knowing we had to work together on a bipartisan basis. and the Senate Intelligence Committee and staff worked very hard on a bipartisan basis to produce a bill. a very good bill. It was the ultimate compromise. There were some on both sides who were sullen but not rebellious. But we got the job done. We provided the tools the intelligence community needed and significantly expanded the protection of American civil liberties and privacy rights. The bill sat on the floor in October. It finally came to the floor December 17. A number on the majority side spoke out against the civil liability protection afforded providers who allegedly assisted the Government with the Presidents terrorist surveillance program. or TSP. They criticized various provisions in the Intelligence Committee bill. They spoke in favor of what regrettably was a partisan Judiciary Committee substitute. Debate is good for democracy but only if it is based on facts. Unfortunately. during the December filibuster. we heard a number of allegations. accusations. and even misrepresentation about the committees bill and the TSP. Some of those comments will be repeated today. Our intelligence community professionals must have the tools they need to protect us. This is not the time to pass legislation that will make people feel good or will score political points. We must pass a bill the DNI will support and. thus. the President will sign. That should be our goal. Distorting the truth will not help us get there. The record must be set straight. and these are some of the myths we have heard. What are the facts? We were told that a ""new and aggressive"" interpretation of article H authority was used to justify the TSP. There is nothing new or aggressive about relying on the Presidents article 1H authority in the context of foreign intelligence surveillance. Courts. including the FISA Court of Review in the 2002 In re: Sealed Case decision and the Fourth Circuit in the Truong case. have long recognized distinctions between domestic and foreign surveillance and the Presidents constitutional authority to conduct foreign intelligence surveillance. Nor is it ""an invitation to lawlessness"" to argue that the President has inherent constitutional authority to wiretap without a court order. The Constitution is the highest law of the land and trumps any statute. In 1978. when Congress recognized the tension between FISA and the Presidents inherent authority under article II. they noted that warrantless surveillance for foreign intelligence gathering has been an integral part of our Nations foreign intelligence. During World War II. our warrantless surveillance of the German and Japanese militaries and the breaking of their codes preserved our democracy. More recently. the Clinton administration conducted a warrantless search of the residence of convicted spy Aldrich Ames. The Intelligence Committee conducted a comprehensive. bipartisan review of the TSP. There is no evidence to substantiate the claims that the administration began its warrantless surveillance before September 11 or that the TSP covered domestic calls between neighbors. friends. and loved ones. As the President has stated. the TSP collected international calls involving members of alQaida. For many months. critics have argued that TSP could have been conducted under FISA. That argument needs to be laid to rest. A decision by a FISA court last spring proved that the TSP could not have been done under FISA as it existed. The court decision resulted in significant intelligence gaps which led to the passage of the Protect America Act. I was not there. but I understand this matter was discussed by the President with the top leaders of this body and the other body. as well as the Intelligence Committee. and was told at the time it would not be possible to redraft and change the old FISA law in time to collect the critical information they hoped to gather before attacks occurred immediately following September 11. The liability protection for those carriers who allegedly assisted the Government with the TSP lies at the heart of this legislation. The President did what he had to do under article II. and our country was safer for it. and our country was safer because some of the carriers alleged to have participated acted in reliance and good faith on orders of the Attorney General. transmitting the Presidents orderand the intelligence community. In his original FISA modernization request in April of 2007. the DNI asked for full liability protection for all those allegedly involved. Some Members have attacked DNI McConnells integrity. calling him ""an accidental truth teller"" and accusing him of backing out of an agreement made under the PAA. These comments are not only unjustified. unwarranted. and unfair. they are counterproductive. Throughout this debate. the DNI and other intelligence professionals have given us unbiased advice and technical assistance. They have assisted Democrats and Republicans. We need to focus on the task at hand. not engage in personal attacks against a man who has served his country honorably in the military and the intelligence community. and continues to do so as head of the community. Some of the Members have downplayed the need for liability protection. They argue that carriers already have statutory immunity and that continued litigation will not harm providers or our intelligence efforts. These statements reflect a startling lack of knowledge about our intelligence collection. which is dangerous to the continued operation of our gathering. First. the companies cannot prove they are entitled to statutory immunity because the Government must assert state secrets to protect their intelligence collection methods. Second. while it is true that the existence of the TSP has been revealed. there are still. fortunately. a few details about the program that have not. Each day the lawsuits continuewith the prospect of civil discoverythere come new risks that sensitive details about our intelligence sources and methods will be revealed. As General Hayden stated a year and a half ago: The disclosure of the TSP has had a significant impact on intelligence gathering of terrorists. We are applying the Darwinian theory. We are only capturing the dumb ones. We should not give terrorists additional insight through continued TSP litigation. Further. our intelligence and law enforcement agencies rely on the willingness of providers to cooperatein emergencies. as with the kidnapping of a child. or when court orders are not required. Yet some carriers have already told us if they do not get liability protection. they will not be able to risk their business. their reputation. by continuing to help without court orders. That would be devastating to our intelligence collection. Our committee weighed all these arguments for and against liability protection. We concluded by a 12to3 bipartisan vote that civil liability protection for providersand only providers. not Government officialswas not only fair. it was the only way to safeguard our intelligence sources and methods. and to ensure the continued cooperation of the providers. Substitution is not a solution since it would allow civil discovery to proceed against providers. still leaving them open to disclosure and exceedingly serious competitive and reputational harm. perhaps even physical retaliation by radicals who oppose our intelligence gathering. The intelligence community advised us through testimony and gave us documents that these companies acted in good faith. and we in the committee agreed with them. The providers who may have participated relied upon representations from the highest levels of Government. There is no need to create a statutory mechanism for a court. whether it be the FISA Court or any other. to secondguess this determination. Allowing a court to do so would throw uncertainty into an area where the committees intent is clear: The ongoing civil litigation against providers must end. On this last point. the term ""amnesty"" was tossed around in December. But that incorrectly assumes that alleged carriers did something illegal. These carriers do not need amnesty. They did nothing wrong. They deserve liability protection. As I mentioned earlier. the DNI said he will support the Intelligence Committees bill with two revisions. Yet some Members insist there are fatal flaws. We heard. No. 1. that there are no consequences if the FISC rejects the targeting/minimization procedures. No. 2. the bill does not contain a ""reverse targeting"" prohibition. and. No. 3. it allows warrantless interception of purely domestic communications. A plain reading of our bill shows that each one of these arguments is false. The bill that came out of our committee goes farther than ever before in providing a meaningful role for the courts and Congress in overseeing acquisitions of foreign intelligence. The FISA Court will review the targeting and minimization procedures to ensure they comply with the law. If the court finds any deficiency. it can order the Government to correct the deficiency or cease the acquisition. There is nothingI repeat. nothingin this bill that will allow warrantless wiretapping of Americans in violation of title III criminal wiretaps or FISA. There are explicit prohibitions against ""reverse targeting"" and the targeting of the person inside the United States without a court order. Americans abroad are given new FISA Court protections. The acquisitions must also comply with the fourth amendment. These are major new protections for Americans. Yet in spite of these measuresprotections we have never seen before in the world of foreign targetingwe have been told the intelligence community will still target innocent Americans. listening to calls between parents and children overseas. between students and their friends studying abroad. That is absolute nonsense. The Intelligence Committees bill only allows targeting of persons outside the United States to obtain foreign intelligence information. This is not a dragnet of surveillance. We are not listening to. quote. completely innocent people overseas. unquote. as some have claimed. The targets must be foreign targetssuspected terrorists or terrorist group membersand the Attorney General and the DNI must certify that a significant purpose of the acquisition is to obtain foreign intelligence information. For example. if a foreign target is believed to be an agent or member of alQaida. then all communications will be intercepted. Only Americans who communicate with that target will have those specific conversations monitored. If those same conversations turn out to be purely innocent. they will be ""minimized."" or suppressed. Even if the communication contains foreign intelligence information. it is likely. in many instances. the identity of any U.S. person will be maskedor protectedin any intelligence reporting. Americans privacy rights are protected up to the point where they are actually engaging in a terrorist operation. Mr. President. I see my time is running out. I will reserve the remainder of my time. I will give the rest of my remarks at a later time. Thank you."
2013,Mr. President. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from Wisconsin.
2013,Mr. President. I thank the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. The Senate should not be having a cloture vote on this legislation today. What we should be doing is considering and voting on the amendments that I and my colleagues tried to bring up last week. and other amendments that have been proposed to improve this badly flawed bill. But the minority does not think we should have the right to actually legislate here. They expect this body to rubberstamp that bill. I am afraid I have to say the conduct of the minority has been very disturbing on this. They insisted for weeks that it is absolutely critical to finish the FISA legislation by February 1. even going so far as to object repeatedly to efforts by the majority leader to extend for only 1 month the Protect America Acta law they rammed through this Chamber in Augustand they still dont want to give us another month so the Senate can carefully consider changes to it. So the majority leader brought to the floor the Intelligence Committee bill. the legislation that the minority wanted to consider and urged the Senate to stay in session through the weekend to complete work on it. I criticized the majority leader for bringing the Intelligence Committee bill to the floor because I thought the Senate should be working from the much better bill reported by the Judiciary Committee. on which I also serve. but I would have thought the minority would be pleased by the majority leaders decision. So what have they done in response? They have obstructed all efforts to actually work on this bill. They will not allow me to get a vote on the one amendment I have offeredan amendment cosponsored by Senator HAGELand they will not allow me or anyone else to offer any other amendments. They filed for cloture the day this Senate began working on the bill. after allowing only a single amendment to be called up. They have effectively halted Senate consideration of this bill. despite the fact they are the onesthey are the oneswho are arguing that the February deadline is so critical. They seem to think that scare tactics peddled by administration officials. such as the Vice President. will be enough to pressure the Senate into letting them have their way. I certainly hope they are wrong. Mr. President. as you well know. this legislation is in serious need of fixing. It authorizes widespread surveillance involving Americans at home and abroad. Yes. it does. Despite what the Senator from Missouri said. it certainly does do that. I have a number of amendments I want to offer. both to ensure that the FISA Court has more authority to oversee these authorities. and to guarantee Americans their fourth amendment rights. But I cannot even get a vote on the one. simple. straightforward. and extremely modest amendment I offered last week. This demonstrates how brazen these tactics are. This bipartisan amendment would merely require that the Government provide copies of important FISA Court orders and pleadings for review to the committees of jurisdiction in a classified setting. so that Members of Congress can understand how FISA has been interpreted and is being applied. You would think this amendment would be. as they say. a nobrainer. and yet the minority will not even consent to a vote on that. But at least that one amendment is pending. and we will get a vote eventu ally. If the Republicans succeed in cutting off debate on this legislation. the Senate will not be able to vote on any other amendments. including the amendment Senator DODD and I wish to offer to deny retroactive immunity to telecom companies that allegedly cooperated with the administrations illegal wiretapping program. It is unconscionable to think that the Senate should have to make a final decision on this legislation without even having an opportunity to debate and vote on whether to grant retroactive immunity to companies that allegedly cooperated with an illegal program. And why are we in this situation? Because the minority and the administration think they are entitled to ram the deeply flawed Intelligence Committee bill through the Senate without any changes. It seems they are worried the Senate might actually pass some of the very reasonable amendments I and others would like to offer if they give us a chance to do so or perhaps they are trying to sabotage the bill and then figure out a way to blame that outcome on Democrats. No Senatorno Senatorshould go along with these cynical. strongarm tactics. We have to stand up to the administration and stand up for our rights. I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose cloture. Invoking cloture on this bill would be an abdication of our responsibility to consider legislation that will have a huge impact on the American people for years to come. I hope even those who support the Intelligence Committee bill will think twice before voting to make this body a rubberstamp. I yield the floor.
2013,Mr. President. I dont know why any Member of the Senate would object to procedures we would employ within the bounds of the law to listen to communications of terrorists in order to detect and deter further terrorist attacks on our own soil or against Americans or our allies. That is what this legislation does. Unfortunately. I think we are beginning to see a dangerous trend on the part of the Senate: Never failing to put off until tomorrow what we could and should do today. This legislation has been considered for an awfully long time. as we all know. in a bipartisan vote of the Senate Intelligence Committee. 13 to 2. In October. this legislation was voted out of the Intelligence Committee in a carefully crafted attempt to consult with the Director of National Intelligence. the head of the Central Intelligence Agency. and all other intelligence community members who might be impacted by this legislation. There has been opportunity after opportunity for input into this legislation by Members of the Senate. Yet we hear today there are those on the floor of the Senate who are saying: Well. lets not vote on this legislation now. Lets kick the ball down the road another month so we can have the same debate. the same discussion we have been having for all those many months leading up to this point. The only reason we are where we are today is because we were unable to get a lengthy extension of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in August. Because of objections by those on the other side who are complaining about this legislation again today. we were only able to pass this legislation until December and then another extension was granted until February 1. when this Protect America Act expires of its own terms. I would hope this body would continue to act in a strong bipartisan manner in which the Intelligence Committee has voted this bill out of the Intelligence Committee by a vote of 13 to 2. I appreciate the fact that this body tabled the Judiciary Committees partisan substitute and sent a signal that bipartisanship and consensus may once again become ascendant in matters of national security in the Senate. I think we would see that as a welcome development. At a time when we are talking about an economic stimulus package and seeing cooperation from the Speaker and the minority leader in the House and the President of the United States on matters affecting the economy. why cant we get that same sort of bipartisan cooperation on matters affecting national security? Today. the Senate is poised to move this critical national security legislation one step closer to the Presidents desk. Todays vote will tell us much more about whether this Senate is ready to set aside partisanship and willing to get the job done. Members of this body will remember that in December we had to pass an Omnibus appropriations bill that affected all discretionary spending of the U.S. Federal Government because we had been unable to pass 11 out of the 12 appropriations bills that it was our responsibility to pass. Unfortunately. this Senate has an unfortunate recent tendency to put off things until tomorrow what we should and could be doing today. and we should not let that happen. We need to finish this legislation to give Members a chance to debate and then to vote. I dont favor each and every provision included in the bipartisan compromise that is sponsored by Chairman ROCKEFELLER and Vice Chairman BOND. but I do appreciate the fact that it is a carefully crafted compromise. It is a bipartisan compromise. It is the product of extensive consultation and negotiation with the experts in our intelligence and defense communities. In other words. this legislation reflects the valuable and necessary input of the very men and women who are currently intercepting phone calls. text messages. and emails between alQaida and their operativesthose who wish to do America and Americas interests harm. The Senate has two choices today as the deadline for action rapidly approaches on February 1. On the one hand. we can show the American people that at least when it comes to matters of national security. it is possible to put partisanship aside and to get the job done in a bipartisan way. The other choice. which the majority leader has proposed. is we ask the American people for an extension. that we kick the can down the road for another month. only to find ourselves back in precisely the same posture we are in today: With no issues resolved and with the same old debates to be rehashed when we ought to finish the job today and follow the path of maximum responsibility. I ask my colleagues: What excuse could there possibly be to put the tough choices off for another month? What justifies asking the American people for more time to get the job done when we know what the choices are and we have simply to make those choices by our vote today. We have had 6 months since the Protect America Act was passed in August of last year to get the job done. In that time. this legislation has been subjected to scrutiny by two Senate committees. and there has been significant time debating this legislation on the floor. The fact is there is no acceptable excuse for failing to do our duty and our job. The excuses offered for delay are as compelling as the old school house claim that my dog ate my homework. I couldnt get it done. I say no more excuses. no more extensions. It is time for Congress to come together in a bipartisan fashion in the national security interests of the United States. It is specious to say there is no consequence to another extension. and it is the height of irresponsibility to argue that delay is the only responsible choice. As Americas elected leaders. we have a responsibility to keep America safe. We cannot simply close our eyes and wish away the terrorist threat. It is easy this many years after September 11 to be lulled into a false sense of security as time takes us further away from that terrible attack on American soil. But it is undeniable that the threat from alQaida and Islamic extremists remains. In the face of the very real threat of radical Islamic terror. Congress must be resolute and we must eschew attempts to split along partisan lines. and we must embrace bipartisan solutions to our very real national security problem. That is what a vote on the Senate Intelligence Committee bill would reflect: a bipartisan solution to a national security challenge. That is why it defies credibility to argue that the responsible thing to do is to put the job off for another month. The majority leaders plea for an extension implies that the only two choices we have are. on the one hand. an extension for 1 month and. on the other hand. no bill at all. Neither of those is a responsible choice. In fact. there is a third option. and that option is for the Senate to pass a consensus bill that has the bipartisan support of the chairman and vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee and a bipartisan majority of the Senate. experts in the intelligence community. and the President of the United States. Lets be clear about what an extension means. An extension means further delay. It means putting off tough choices. It means not only to do so in a time of war but in a time of economic fragility. when we have other work we need to be doing on the floor of the Senate that is being taken up unnecessarily by repeating the same arguments over and over without any conclusion. It also means Congress has lacked the courage to relieve some of Americas leading companies from the burdens and costs of litigation arising from their cooperation in the war on terror. Let us remember the telecommunications companies that may have cooperated with our Government at the request of our President. and upon the certification of the Attorney General. the chief law enforcement officer. that what they were being asked to do was within the law. To continue to subject them to litigation for doing their civic duty. to incur ongoing expense and inconvenience and to risk information that is sensitive to our security coming out during the process is simply not a responsible option. Some in Congress apparently think these companies should have secondguessed the legal representations made by the President and the Attorney General in the days and weeks and months following the 9/11 attacks. Some in Congress have argued that the companies had a duty not to cooperate. a duty to refuse to assist this Nations intelligence community with tracking terrorists during wartime. That is. unfortunately. how far we have come in this debate and how off the mark some have come. These companies. as every good citizen who cooperates with their Government to try to keep America secure in good faith. deserve the protection we are being asked to give them in this legislation. These costly lawsuits have not only put in jeopardy the future cooperation of these firms but also the critical national security concerns potentially exposed to the discovery process in civil litigation. It may be popular in some quarters to bash corporate America. but that rhetoric is sorely misplaced in this debate. The men and women who manage these companies made a goodfaith decision to do their patriotic dutyto help their Government to track terrorists and to save American lives. and they should not be punished for it. They should be thanked for their cooperation. For Congress to allow these burdensome lawsuits to continue this long is unfortunate and unjust indeed. but for Congress to continue to put off the tough choices and leave these companies in legal limbo is not only unfortunate and unjust. it is also irresponsible. Now is the time for Congress to decide the questionno more excuses. no more delays. no more extensions. Today. the Senate can choose a path forward. a bipartisan path on critical national security measures. and I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work together to move this bipartisan bill forward by voting for cloture at 4:30. I yield the floor.
2013,"Mr. President. I rise today in support of cloture on S. 2248. the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments Act. or FISA Amendments Act. Time is running out on congressional action to fix FISA. The Protect America Act. which Congress passed in August to close gaps in our foreign intelligence collection. expires this Friday. February 1. 2008. Prior to congressional action in August. our intelligence community was unable to collect vital foreign intelligence without the prior approval of a court. And I emphasize in that ""foreign"" intelligence. This will be the case again if we do not make permanent these changes. Before August. if our intelligence community wanted to direct surveillance at an alQaida member located in Pakistan who was communicating with an operative terrorist in Germany. they would have to first petition the FISA Court for approval. In August of this year. our intelligence community told us that without updating FISA. they were not just handicapped. but they were hamstrung. The Protect America Act temporarily fixed the intelligence community legal gaps. The Director of National Intelligence highlighted some of the critical intelligence gained under the Protect America Act. including: insight and understanding leading to disruption of planned terrorist attacks. efforts of an individual to become a suicide operative. instructions to a foreign terrorist associate about entering the United States. efforts by terrorists to obtain guns and ammunition. terrorist facilitator plans to travel to Europe. identifying information regarding foreign terrorist operatives. plans for future terrorist attacks. and movements of key extremists to abate a risk. With the Protect America Act set to expire. Congress must act swiftly before our core collectors are faced with losing this kind of valuable intelligence as a result of inaction by Congress. Although the Protect America Act enabled the intelligence community to continue its important work. Congress would be derelict in its duties to merely extend the expiration of this act. The Senate Intelligence Committee has been reviewing and drafting FISA legislation since April of last year. Last fall. the committee considered and passed the bill that is now before us. In December. the bill came to the Senate floor for consideration. but some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle delayed its consideration. We are now faced. after almost 10 months of thorough consideration. with the ability to pass legislation which will improve our intelligence collection and which contains safeguards for U.S. citizens privacy rights that the Protect America Act does not contain."
2013,"Mr. President. I rise today in opposition to the Intelligence Committees version of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments Act of 2007. It is without question that I support giving the administration the surveillance tools it needs to keep us safe. But Congress has both a duty to keep the American people safe and uphold the Constitution. It is therefore incumbent upon us in the Senate to craft clear legislation that protects both our national security and our civil liberties. We can do that by passing the Judiciary Committee substitute. which gives the administration the tools it needs to collect foreign intelligence and protects innocent Americans by ensuring that the FISA Court. and not the Attorney General. decides whether surveillance of a U.S. person is proper. One of the defining challenges of our age is to combat international terrorism while maintaining our national values and our commitment to the rule of law and individual rights. These two obligations are not mutually exclusive. Indeed. they reinforce one another. Unfortunately. the Presidents national security policies have operated at the expense of our civil liberties. The examples are legion. but the issue that prompted the legislation before us today is one of the most notorioushis secret program of eavesdropping on Americans without congressional authorization or a judges approval. After insisting for a year that the President was not bound by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Acts clear prohibition on warrantless surveillance of Americans. the administration subjected its surveillance program to FISA Court review in January of last year. Then. last August. citing operational difficulties and heightened threats that required changes to FISA. the administration passed the Protect America Actover my objection and that of many of my colleagues. The Protect America Act. which sunsets at the end of this month. amended FISA to allow warrantless surveillance. even when that surveillance intercepts the communications of innocent American citizens inside the United States. The administration identified two problems it faced in conducting electronic surveillance under FISA. First. the administration wanted clarification that it did not need to obtain a FISA warrant in order to conduct surveillance of calls between two parties when both of those parties are overseas. Because of the way global communications are now transmitted. many communications between people all of whom are overseas are nonetheless routed through switching stations inside the United States. In other words. when someone in Islamabad. Pakistan. calls someone in London. that call is likely to be routed through communications switching stations right here in the United States. Congress did not intend FISA to apply to such calls. and I support a legislative fix to clarify that point. The second problem the administration identified is more difficult. Even assuming that the government does not need a FISA warrant to tap into switching stations here in the United States in order to intercept calls between two people who are abroadbetween Pakistan and England. for exampleif the target in Pakistan calls someone inside the United States. FISA requires the government to get a warrant. even though the government is ""targeting"" the caller in Pakistan. The administration wants the flexibility to begin electronic surveillance of a ""target"" abroad without having to get a FISA warrant to account for the possibility that the ""foreign target"" might contact someone in the United States. I agree with the administrations assessment of the problem. but I dont support its solution. The administrations proposal. which is reflected in the Intelligence Committees version of the FISA Amendments Act. would significantly expand the scope of surveillance permitted under FISA by exempting entirely any calls to or from the United States. as long as the government is ""targeting"" someone reasonably believed to be located outside the United States. The government could acquire these communications regardless of whether either party is suspected of any wrongdoing. The Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence would make the determination about whom to target on their own. and they would merely certify. afterthefact. to the FISA Court that they had reason to believe the target was outside the United States. regardless of how many calls to innocent American citizens inside the United States were intercepted in the process. This Intelligence Committee bill authorizes surveillance that is broader than what is necessary to protect national security and that is why I oppose it. The Intelligence Committee bill offers no protection for the innocent Americans who communicate with overseas relatives. business partners. or friends. Indeed. it allows the government unfettered access to these innocent Americans communications. And once the government collects these communications. it can share them with other agencies throughout the government. The Judiciary Committee substitutewhich authorizes much broader surveillance powers than the government had under FISA before the Protect America Act became lawoffers several significant protections. I will mention a few: First. the Judiciary Substitute protects against the ""bulk collection"" of communications by requiring the government to target a specific person or phone number abroad. rather than allowing the acquisition in bulk the millions of communications going into and out of the United States. Second. it requires the government to obtain an individualized warrant from the FISA Court if the governments acquisition of a person inside the United States becomes a significant purpose of its surveillance of the foreign target. Third. it provides for much more robust and meaningful congressional oversight. And fourth. it does not provide retroactive immunity for the telecommunications carriers. I oppose granting retroactive immunity because if the carriers violated clearly stated Federal law. they should be held accountable. Cases against the carriers are already making their way through the courts. Retroactive immunity would undermine the judiciarys role as an independent branch of government. Furthermore. the provision that holds carrier liable for violations of the act is an important enforcement mechanism. It is fundamental to securing the privacy rights that FISA was meant to protect. When the Senate passed FISA. after extensive hearings. 30 years ago by a strong bipartisan vote of 95 to 1. I stated that it ""was a reaffirmation of the principle that it is possible to protect national security and at the same time the Bill of Rights."" I still believe thats possible. but not if we enact the Intelligence Committee bill. Mr. President. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum."
2013,Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.
2013,Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the time for the quorum we will go into be equally divided between Senators BOND and ROCKEFELLER.
2013,I suggest the absence of a quorum.
2013,Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.
2013,Mr. President. how much time is remaining on our side?
2013,"Mr. President. while we are waiting for Members of the other side to come forward. I will make a few remarks. and we will see if we have some others join us. I was talking about some of the proposed amendments and questions that have arisen about this bill. There are some who would demand that a court order be obtained any time a call involved a U.S. citizen. But anybody who understands FISA or intelligence collection knows that is operationally impossible. For 30 years. the intelligence community has used minimization procedures when inadvertently intercepted calls come to or from nontargeted U.S. persons. So far. we are totally unaware of any abuses of this system. The minimization procedures have worked well. They worked well when information was being collected by radio. without a FISA Court order. and they continue to work well because the welltrained people who run the NSA operations are overseen by multiple layers of supervisors and inspectors general and attorneys from the Department of Justice. There is no way to know. when a terror suspect places a call from a location in the Middle East. whether that person is going to call someone in his country or a neighboring country or the United States. So if you say you cannot intercept that call if it goes to a U.S..person. what. in effect. you are saying is you cannot intercept that call because you dont know where the call is going. So it means there will have to be an order for every foreign terrorist surveillance conducted by the NSA. and that is totally unworkable. We have seen that before. That shut the system down. It is unsound policy to require a FISA Court order if a terrorist target abroad calls a U.S. person. That may be the most important call to intercept in order to protect us from a terrorist attack at any time. and time matters. Do we really mean that the call cannot be intercepted until a court filing is prepared and reviewed by Government lawyers and that the FISA Court must review the application and supporting amendments? I hope not. Our enemies are not stupid. They would figure out very quickly that they can slow us down and bring our intelligence community to a halt simply by placing periodic calls to the United States. Some believe that the FISA framework in place is enough to keep us safe and that we dont need the Intelligence Committee bill. I find that comment disturbing. It is the FISA framework that created significant intelligence gaps threatening the security of our Nation. It is only because we passed the Protect America Act that those gaps were closed. I have already spoken about the problems with the Judiciary Committee bill. I wish to address some concerns and some ideas raised about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. the FISA Court. I think our bill out of the Intelligence Committee strikes the appropriate balance between providing tools needed to collect intelligence and a meaningful oversight role for Congress and the FISA Court. There are a lot of misperceptions about the FISA Court. As mentioned previously. for example. there are those who suggest the court should have decided whether providers acted in good faith before immunity is granted. We were told this makes sense because the court ""sits 24/7 and this is all they do. They would act en banc."" That is not accurate. The FISA Court does not sit 24 hours a day. 7 days a week. It is composed of U.S. judges from U.S. district courts throughout the country who have their own full caseloads and come to Washington. DC. on a rotating basis simply. as the enabling legislation says. to issue FISA Court orders. As a result. it would be difficult to get them to sit together. Given the courts facilities. it is not set up to preside over litigation. We were told that this is why the FISA Court was set up. but the legislative history and the measures-"
2013,Mr. President. I will then close and urge that our colleagues adopt cloture so that we may move forward on this very important bill. I yield the floor.
2013,Mr. President. how much time remains on our side?
2013,I yield 9Y2 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.
2013,"Mr. President. I thank the manager of the legislation. Senator ROCKEFELLER. Once again. I will say that I have great admiration for the work done by the committee. It is not an easy matter. The Intelligence Committee has serious work to do. Much of what they have done. I agree with. My objections here this afternoon are focused on one aspect of the legislation rather than the cumulative effort the committee has made. Let me address the issue we will be voting on. and that is cloture. That is a critical issue for all of us. Aside from the question of whether I agree or disagree with various amendments. or even the bill. we find ourselves in the midst of a parliamentary nightmare. We have been in this position since late last year. going back to December. So much hinges on this bill. It will set Americas terrorist surveillance policy well into the next Presidential term and beyond if a period of 6 years is adopted or even the 4 years suggested by Senator CARDIN and others. Depending on the outcome of the debate. this legislation has the power to bring that surveillance under the rule of law or to confirm the Presidents urge to be a law of his own. It has the power to bring the facts of warrantless spying to light and to public scrutiny. or to lock down those facts as the property of only the powerful. It has the power. obviously. to declare the same law applies to all of us regardless of economic circumstances. well connected or not. or to set the precedent that some corporations are far too rich. far too affluent to be sued. that immunity can effectively not be brought against them. Wherever you come down on these choicesand I know there are those of us who have different opinionsyou certainly cannot be neutral. in my view. None of us can be neutral on a matter such as this. This is one of the most important and contentious pieces of legislation we will debate in this session. and I argue any session of Congress. and yet the Senate is frozen today. I objected passionately to retroactive immunity. but I did not shut out debate. Republicans have frozen this body since debate began. not only lastweek but going back further. and they unwittingly created a perfect microcosm of retroactive immunity right here in this body. Because both flow from the same impulse: shutting down the organs of Governmentin this case. the legislation. the courts. and now. because of the procedural nightmare we find ourselves in. the Senatewhen you are afraid. of course. you will not get your way. That is why President Bush wants his favored corporations saved from lawsuits. it appears. That is why the minority party wants this bill saved from any and all amendments. saved from serious and thoughtful discussion. As a committee chairman myself. as I pointed out the other day. I wish I had the privilege being requested by the minority. I sometimes wished the bills we passed out of committee would have swept out of this body when I came to the Senate floor without a single amendment. That is not how this body works. It was never intended to work that way. It is certainly not the way the Founders intended it to work. Amendments are not entitled to pass. but they are entitled to a fair hearing. a fair debate. and a fair vote. The minority can object as strenuously as it wants. but it must do so fairly. I accept that principle. even when it does not go my way. even on immunity itself. I understand a minority cannot stand forever. Is it too much for Republicans to extend the same courtesy? On a bill as important as this one. it would be ridiculous to curtail debate. shut out new ideas. or rush to a conclusion without even extending the Protect America Act for a month to give us the time we need. Whether you agree with them or notand some I disagree with myselfthe amendments offered by my Democratic colleagues are serious proposals and deserving of serious consideration. Shouldnt we debate whether this new surveillance regime ought to stay inflexible through the next Presidential term and into the one after that? Shouldnt we debate whether we are going to categorically outlaw unconstitutional reverse targeting or indiscriminate vacuum cleaner bulk collection? Shouldnt we debate whether Congress even gets to see the secret rulings of the FISA Court? Those are some of a few of the wellintentioned proposals we need to consider before we vote on this bill. But across the board. the Republican answer to those questions is absolutely not. in every single instance: No debate. no votes. I disagree. and I will vote against cloture because we havent done our job yet. I will also vote against cloture because I cannot support the bill as it now stands. as my colleagues know. First. the legislation still contains some egregious provisions for corporate immunity. I already made my objection to immunity many times over the last number of days. It puts the Presidents chosen few above the law. in my view. it endorses possibly illegal spying on Americans. and it strikes a harsh blow against the rule of law. I will continue to fight retroactive immunity with all the strength any one Senator can muster. But I also strongly object to many of the intelligencegathering portions of the bill. as well as supporting many of them that have been included. This bill reduces court oversight of spying nearly to the point of symbolism. It would allow the targeting of Americans on false pretenses. It opens up new twisted rationales for warrantless wiretapping. which is exactly what it ought to prevent. It could allow bulk collection of communications of millions of Americans as soon as an administration. whether this one or future one. has the wherewithal to build such an enormous dragnet. and it sets all of these deeply flawed provisions in stone for 6 years. depriving us of the flexibility we need to fight terrorism. For all of those reasons. as well. I will vote against cloture later this afternoon. Tonight. the President will come to Congress to speak to us and to the American people about the state of our Union. I hope he will use that opportunity to realize the Senate needs more time to do its constitutional duty to debate and consider this important legislation. However. I am concerned that he will instead continue to threaten to veto this legislation unless it includes retroactive immunity for the telecommunications industry. The President has said this bill is essential to ""protecting the American people from enemies who attacked our country."" That is a quotation. So why is he trying to stop it? Why is he promising to veto it? Why is he throwing it all away to protect a few corporations from lawsuits? I fear that if we give this President what he wants. we risk weakening the rule of law and placing the rights of some of the Presidents favored corporations over the rights of ordinary American citizens. I hope my colleagues will join with those of us who oppose cloture today on the substitute amendment to allow the Senate the time it needs to debate and improve the FISA Amendments Act. This issue is far too important for the security of our Nation and to our civil liberties to do otherwise. As we all know. as I have stated over and over. this is historic tension that dates back to the founding of our Republic. of keeping us safe from those who would do us harm. and protecting the rights and liberties of American citizens. It has been a tension that has been debated and argued for more than 200 years. and the adoption of the FISA legislation three decades ago created the means by which that balance could be struck. allowing us to do what is necessary to protect us against those who would do us harm while simultaneously guaranteeing those rights and liberties we enjoy as Americans would be protected in these circumstances. It is a critical point to maintain that balance. My fear is this legislation. particularly with retroactive immunity. upsets that balance significantly. As I said before. and I will repeat in closing. had this been a few months. even a year in the wake of 9/11. had this administration had a record of by and large supporting the rule of law. I would not stand here and demand that we not include retroactive immunity under those circumstances. But there has been a pattern of behavior by this administration from the very outset. We now know these warrantless wiretaps began in January or February of 2001. not in the wake of 9/11. So even prior to the tragic events of September 11. 2001. this administration had begun a pattern of seeking warrantless wiretaps on average American citizens without the court orders provided for under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Of course. it went on for 5 years and would still be ongoing were it not for a whistleblower in a report in a major American newspaper uncovering this program. This went on for 5 long years amidst a pattern of behavior by this administration. I do not think I need to necessarily enumerate the examples of that pattern. beginning with Abu Ghraib. secret prisons and rendition. habeas corpus. the U.S. Attorneys Of-"" fice. and the list goes on and on. I cannot undo those mistakes. but they are more than just mistakes. They are tragic examples of this administrations trampling all over the rule of law. What we can do this evening and what we can do in the coming days. collectively. Democrats and Republicans. is pass a FISA bill. much of which is included in the work of Senator ROCKEFELLER and Senator BOND. There will be some objections. obviously. to some amendments that will be offered. but to get our work done. pass this legislation. and move on to other business. The issues are far too important to leave them otherwise. I thank. again. Senator ROCKEFELLER for giving me some time and urge our colleagues to vote against the cloture motion when that moment occurs. I yield the floor."
2013,I suggest the absence of a quorum.
2013,Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.
2013,"Mr. President. we are now only a few days away from the expiration of the Protect America Act. days away from a situation in which the intelligence community will be unable to freely monitor new terrorist targets overseas. We are flirting with disaster. and the American people deserve to know how we got in this predicament. So let me review it. Ten months ago. the Director of National Intelligence asked us to reform the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Our friends on the other side waited until July to take up a bill that agreed with his recommendations. It was not until August that Congress finally answered his pleas by authorizing for 6 months the overseas surveillance of foreign terrorist targets with the Protect America Act. When our friends on the other side got back from the August break. they vowed to quickly address what they decried as the shortcomings of the Protect America Act. The Senate Intelligence Committee. under the leadership of Senator ROcKEFELLER and Senator BOND. took up the task. Reforming FISA was complicated and demanding work. but the committee members came together. as they were intended to. along with the executive branch. which. of course. was necessary. Everyone involved acted with determination. deliberation. and considerable skill. The process lasted 4 months. It involved numerous hearings. briefings. and negotiation sessions. The final product was a model of bipartisanship and accommodation across the Senate aisle and with the White House. The committee vote was not 15 to 0. but around here 13 to 2 is almost as impressive. But what was perhaps even more impressive is the fact that such a broad coalition of players had come together to meet the minimum standards required of any legislation that replaces the Protect America Act. something that allows the intelligence community to operate without unreasonable and counterproductive restrictions. which protect phone carriers from frivolous lawsuits for helping the Government hunt for terrorists. and which is guaranteed to be signed into law. All of those things are contained in the BondRockefeller. RockefellerBond proposal. Unfortunately. it was not until just before the Christmas break that our friends decided to even turn back to this vital issue. and even then we had to listen to a filibuster against FISA reform. Then when we began this session. our Democratic colleagues delayed consideration of FISA reform again by moving to the Indian health care bill instead. So here we are. once again. pushed up against a looming deadline. During last weeks consideration of the FISA reauthorization. the majority said it would not consider a 60vote threshold for votes. It did not offer time agreements. nor did it make any effort to limit the number of amendments. In short. the Senate faces a legislative logjam that ensures that we will let the February 1 deadline come and go without making a reasonable effort to enact a law. It should not have turned out this way. The administration negotiated in good faith with the Democratic majority on the committee that has the technical. operational expertise to handle the subject. And in the course of painstaking negotiations. the administration made tough concessions to our Democratic colleagues. It did this in order to arrive at a fair. bipartisan result that would allow it to continue to protect the homeland. Now that work is being brushed aside. The menu of amendments to the Intelligence Committee bill is little more than an effort to renegotiate this hardwon deal. an effort to deconstruct the bipartisan Intelligence Committee bill. and reconstruct. amendment by amendment. the divisive Judiciary Committee bill that was tabled by a strong bipartisan majority. That bill will notI repeat. will notbecome law. Reconstructing the Judiciary Committee bill is a pointless exercise. And with only 5 days until the Protect America Act expires. it is an exercise in which we do not have the luxury to engage. We can get serious and pass the bipartisan Intelligence Committee product or we can waste time on voting for poison pill amendments that weaken the bill and that will prevent it from becoming law. I urge our colleagues to make the right choice. to vote for cloture so that we can continue to protect the homeland and against cloture on the 30day extension. We cannot delay this important legislation for another month. Of course. the President will not sign a 30day extension. That said. if we cannot complete this bill. Republicans will not allow this critical program to expire and will offer a shortterm extension. if necessary. To be perfectly clear. I urge that there be a ""yes"" vote on cloture on the bill. a ""no"" vote on cloture on the 30day extension. an amendment to the bill which actually would not achieve a 30day extension anyway but I think is a place that we do not want to go on record as having supported because the President will not sign that anyway. And in the next few days. we will consider what kind of shortterm options might be appropriate to let us get back to this very important legislation so painstakingly put together by the expert leadership of Senator ROCKEFELLER and Senator BOND. I yield the floor."
2013,Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum. and I ask that the time involved be divided between the two sides.
2013,Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.
2013,Mr. President. I apologize to my friends for keeping everyone waiting. It hasnt been longa matter of a minute or so. In a few hours. President Bush will stand across the way in the House Chamber and deliver his final State of the Union Address. This will be his eighth State of the Union Address. From what I have heard earlier today in my meetings with the press who met with him. it is a fair bet in this speech that he will continue the drumbeat started by Vice President CHENEY last week by trying to scare the American people into believing that if he does not get his way on the FISA bill now before us. Americas national security will be gravely jeopardized. I have said on more than one occasion in recent days we face a faltering economy here at home and a failing foreign policy abroad. So I call upon all of us. Democrats and Republicans. to rise above partisanship. I have also said on more than one occasion that we extend our hand to the President and congressional Republicans and ask them to join with us in a genuine spirit of bipartisanship. In my nearly 26 years. I have never seen anything quite as cynical and counterproductive as the Republican approach to FISA. I gave the example in my last statement that it was a Catch22 the President has put us.in. The American people deserve to know when President Bush talks about the foreign intelligence legislation tonight that he is doing little more than shooting for cheap political points. and we should reject any statements he makes about this. Members of Congress from both parties have legitimate policy disagreements on FISAboth parties. Some of us believe that history proves the need for more protections against Government abuse. Others support the law the way it stands. Now. that is appropriate. people have different views and opinions on an important part of our legislation and our laws in the country. But all of us. Members of Congress. Democrats and Republicans. want to wage an effective fight against terror. All of us. Democrats and Republicans. want to give our intelligence professionals the tools they need to win this fight against terror. We will be taking two votes. The first is on whether to invoke cloture on the BondRockefeller substitute to the FISA bill we have on the floor. The second is a substitute. on whether to extend the authorities of the Protect America Act for another 30 days while Congress works to pass a new FISA bill. I will oppose cloture on the substitute and support cloture on the extension. The extension will give the Congress time to debate and pass a longterm bill that protects America - without compromising the privacy of lawabiding Americans. Both the Intelligence. Committee bill and the Judiciary Committee bill authorize the same surveillance tools our intelligence community needs. Democrats and Republicans stand together in all the terrorism fighting components of this bill. Some Democrats. including me. support the additional privacy protections in the Judiciary Committee bill. Others are satisfied with the protections in the Intelligence Committee bill. Again. people are entitled to their opinions. but all of us believe the Senate should have an opportunity to vote on these important questions. There was a nice piece written in one of the opeds today talking about how the Republicans have talked a long time about all we want is an upordown vote. Well. if there were ever a time they should follow their own advice it is nowan upordown vote. Many Democrats. including Chairman ROCKEFELLER. who has worked so hard. are going to oppose cloture on the substitute because they objectwe objectto the heavyhanded tactics we saw with this legislation this past week. The Republican leader filed cloture on this bill after we had been on the floor for a few hours. Cloture was filed after Republicans blocked every amendment--every amendmentfrom being offered and blocked all amendments from getting votes. In simple terms. this means the Republicans were filibustering their own billtheir own legislation. Let me repeat that. The Republicans were filibustering their own legislation. In my time in the Senate. I cant remember this taking place. Meanwhile. at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. President Bush has actually threatened to veto a temporary extension. Talk about trying to figure out what is in the mind of someone who is talking that way. Let us remember. a temporary extension would guarantee that all the terrorism fighting tools remain in effect. There is absolutely no policy or security problem with an extension. All it would do is give us more time to work this out on an uninterrupted basis. There is no reason to vote against an extension or for the President to veto one. except for political posturing. None of us want the current law to expire. None of us want that to expire. except CHENEY and Bush. But if it does expire because of Republican tactics. surveillance will not end. Even if they stop us from extending the bill. it would not end. Surveillance would not end. All surveillance orders issued under the law we passed last Augustthe Protect America Actare effective for a year. so they will continue until at least August of 2008--August of this year. Even in a last resortif the current law expiresour intelligence professionals can get surveillance orders under the FISA law as it has existed January 28. 2008 COll for decades. before we passed the Protect America Act last August. FISA includes provisions for emergency warrantless surveillance. and it always has. Again. no one is arguing the law should be allowed to expire. Doing so would send the wrong message. But it still is going to allow the collection of this information. The safeguards in place ensure that our war on terror will not be adversely affected. and anyone who says otherwisefrom the President on downis not being truthful. Why do Democrats seek an extension? We believe bipartisanship is appropriate when possible. The economic stimulus package shows us that when circumstances are difficult. we can work together. The Republican leaderships actions in this FISA debate have not given us reason for confidence that they are interested in working with us. but we owe it to the American people to give them every opportunity to do SO. We have requested a 30day extension repeatedlyI have done it repeatedlyand each time the Republicans have said no. Compromise is a twoway street. Bipartisanship is a twoway street. As I said last week. we are willing to pass an extension of current law for 2 weeks. 30 days. 18 months. 14 months. 15 months or whatever our colleagues want. but we need to pass an extension now if we are to ensure the law doesnt expire. I have explained if it expires what happens. The House is going out of session shortly. They have a retreat this weekafter tomorrow. Already Democrats have introduced several amendments to strengthen the bill. Senator FEINGOLD sought a vote on his amendment to provide FISA Court documents to the Senate Intelligence Committee. Republicans blocked that. Senator WHITEHOUSE sought to offer an amendment to give the FISA Court authority to review compliance with minimization rules to protect the privacy of Americans whose communications are inadvertently intercepted. We were blocked from having that vote. Senator CARDIN sought to offer an amendment to sunset the legislation in 4 years rather than 6 years. Even that was blocked from having a vote. Senator KENNEDY offered an amendmentor I should say tried to offer oneproviding for a report by the inspectors general of the relevant agencies to review the conduct of these programs in the past. No vote on that either. Senator FEINSTEIN sought to offer an amendment making crystal clear that FISA is the exclusive means by which the executive branch may conduct surveillance. Blocked by the Republicans. Whether these amendments pass or not. we should be allowed to have votes on them. Senator FEINGOLD wasnt saying he wanted to talk for 2 hours. Senator FEINSTEIN wasnt saying she wanted to talk a long time. No one wasa short debate and have a vote on them. We were prevented from doing that. So what does the Senate do? We take up bills all the time reported to us by committees. This is a little more complicated because we had two committees. It is not often we have concurrent jurisdiction. but there was here. But an eighth grade student could figure out what it is all about. It is not that difficult. Senators offer amendments to these bills and we let the Senate work its will. I dont understand how the Republicans can expect to block us from voting on any amendments and expect us to follow along. Senators are entitled to vote on their amendments. Now. if someone is stallingand we all went through thatthere comes a time when you shut off the debate. But there is none of that here. With the Republicans blocking the amendments I have talked about. we havent gotten to the crucial issue of immunity. Mr. President. I will use my leader time now. Let us not forget: The question of retroactive immunity wouldnt be before us if President Bush hadnt ignored Congress and established his own process outside the law. But far from taking responsibility for his actions. the President bullies and threatens the Congress he is supposed to be working with. He is similar to the kid in the school yard. the bully who says: OK. you are not doing what I want to do. so I am taking my ball home and none of us will be able to play. When the President talks tonight about how important this program is and how it must continue. I say to him now that he must consider and reconsider his political posturing and ask his colleagues in the Senate to support an extension. especially when he is going to come and say how much he wants to work on a bipartisan basis. We are a deliberative body. It was set up that way by the Founding Fathers. Let us deliberate. I urge my colleagues to oppose cloture on the substitute so the Senate can return to considering this bill. We must pass a bill that gives our intelligence authorities the tools they need while protecting the privacy of all Americans. I urge my colleagues to support the extension so we can ensure current authority doesnt expire while Congress works to pass a new and stronger FISA bill.
2013,Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the second vote be of 10 minutes duration.
2013,"I announce that the Senator from Iowa . the Senator from Connecticut . and the Senator from Florida are necessarily absent. I further announce that. if present and voting. the Senator from Iowa would vote ""nay."""
2013,"The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Oklahoma . the Senator from North Carolina . the Senator from Nevada . and the Senator from Arizona . Further. if present and voting. the Senator from North Carolina would have voted ""yea."""
2013,Mr. President. I wanted to take a moment to explain the next vote. The President indicated over the weekend that he would veto a 30day extension. We have been dealing with this issue for almost a year. We have in the RockefellerBond proposal a bipartisan compromise that came out of Intelligence 13 to 2. There is no need for a 30day extension. But even if there were. you wouldnt get a 30day extension by adding it to this bill. It is extremely important to oppose the 30day extension. We know it wont become law on this bill. It wouldnt become law if it were passed freestanding. because the President would veto it. We may be talking about a very shortterm extension here in the next few days. but we are still on FISA after today. We will not get off FISA until we make some determination of how we are going to dispose of this important measure. I urge all my colleagues to vote against cloture on the 30day extension amendment.
2013,Mr. President. we all acknowledge the Intelligence Committee did a good job on this piece of legislation. But the Intelligence Committee knew. everyone knew. there was concurrent referral of this legislation. It was always anticipated and believed. rightfully so. that the Judiciary Committee would take up this matter. And they did. They made some suggestions in the way of changes. We are entitled to vote on those. That is all we are asking. That isnt too unreasonable. For the President to not agree to any extension is unreasonable. The House is going to pass a 30day extension in the morning. They are going to pass that. We are going to have the opportunity to vote on a 30day extension. This would send an appropriate message to everyone that a 30day extension is fair and reasonable. As I said in my remarks before the last vote. people are crying wolf a little too often. This legislation we have before us. if it doesnt pass. the work done by the Intelligence Committee and the Judiciary Committee will go for naught. But still. under the legislation we passed previously. the legislation will still be in effect. FISA is not gone. We all want to work to improve this. That is what this is all about. But we need some votes to do that. That is what we are asking. Everyone here should understand. if you are voting today not to extend this legislation for 30 days. you are going to have to vote on it in the near future because the House is sending us the exact same measure tomorrow.
2013,"I announce that the Senator from Iowa . the Senator from Connecticut . and the Senator from Florida are necessarily absent. I further announce that. if present and voting. the Senator from Iowa would vote ""yea."""
2013,"The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator from Oklahoma . the Senator from North Carolina . the Senator from Nevada . and the Senator from Arizona . Further. if present and voting. the Senator from North Carolina would have voted ""nay."""
2013,Mr. President. I move to reconsider the vote.
2013,I move to lay that motion on the table. The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.
2013,"Mr. President. I rise today with a heavy heart and deep sense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave soldier. SGT Jon Michael Schoolcraft. HI. 26 years old. died January 19 in Taji. Iraq. Sergeant Schoolcraft died of injuries he sustained when an improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle. With an optimistic future before him. Jon risked everything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts. in a land halfway around the world. Jon Schoolcraft. called Mike by his friends. graduated from Wapakoneta High School in Ohio in 2001. Growing up in Ohio with his mother. Cindy SchoolcraftHooker. Mike also spent time in Madison. IN. visiting his father. Mike Schoolcraft. Jr. Mike excelled at sports and particularly enjoyed skateboarding. His sense of duty to his country and a desire to see the world drove him to enroll in the Armys Delayed Entry Program while in high school. After serving a first tour in Iraq. Mike reenlisted. telling a friend that he could not imagine doing anything other than being a soldier. In November of last year. Mike married his wife Amber and decided that his next tour in Iraq would be his last so they could begin a family. Mike was assigned to C Company. 1st Battalion. 27th Infantry Regiment. 25th Infantry Division in Schofield Barracks. HI. For his extraordinary service. Mike was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart. Today. I join Mikes family and friends in mourning his death. While January 28. 2008 COPN we struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss. we can also take pride in the example he set. bravely fighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and strength of character that people will remember when they think of Mike. Today and always. Mike will be remembered by family members. friends and fellow soldiers as a true American hero. and we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country. As I search for words to do justice in honoring Mikes sacrifice. I am reminded of President Lincolns remarks as he addressed the families of the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ""We cannot dedicate. we cannot consecrate. we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men. living and dead. who struggled here. have consecrated it. far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we say here. but it can never forget what they did here."" This statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago. as I am certain that the impact of Mikes actions will live on far longer than any record of these words. It is my sad duty to enter the name of SGT Jon Michael Schoolcraft. III. in the RECORD of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and for his profound commitment to freedom. democracy and peace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged. and the unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes. I hope that families like Mikes can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah who said. ""He will swallow up death in victory. and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces."" May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn. and may God be with all of you. as I know He is with Mike."
2013,Mr. President. over the past few months. our country has experienced instability and volatility in its credit markets. This looming credit crisis is affecting virtually every sector of the economy. including small business financing. Since its inception in 1953. the Small Business Administrations 7(a) loan guaranty program has become the largest single source of longterm capital for small businesses. However. in the wake of the credit crunch and a slowing U.S. economy. we are now noticing that this essential financing resource is not serving nearly as many small businesses as it should. For example. during the first quarter of the 2008 fiscal year. 7(a) lending was down by 12 percent compared with the same period last year. In addition. at his State of the Agency Address this past Tuesday. SBA Administrator Steven Preston acknowledged that SBA lending was down in its largest program. The Small Business Stimulus Act of 2008 will help reverse this downward trend in small business lending. The bill will temporarily reduce the fees collected from borrowers and lenders. This will immediately reduce the cost of capital for small businesses. With lower monthly loan payments. more money will be placed into the hands of small business owners money that will be quickly injected into the economy through purchases of inventory. real estate. and equipment. The fee reduction for lenders. coupled with the government guarantee. will give them an incentive to make 7(a) loans. as banks are scrambling for ways to salvage declining revenues and take on less risky loans. A similar stimulus was adopted after 9/11. and lending increased to businesses nationwide. pumping almost $3 billion into local economies and creating or retaining more than 90.000 jobs. The bill also provides additional funding for the SBAs microloan program. As its name implies. microloans are smallscale business loans. which provide an essential financing source to underserved members of the business population. including women and minorities. This bill provides $12 million to expand the SBAs microloan program. including $2 million that will help leverage nearly $20 million in microloans. The Small Business Stimulus Act of 2008 also includes two business tax incentives that will help small businesses that are feeling the impact of the economic downturn. The first provision would increase the amount that businesses can expense from $125.000 to $200.000 for 2008. This will help businesses immediately write off business purchases. The second provision increases the net operating carry back period for losses arising in taxable years ending in 2007 and 2008 from 2 years to 5 years. This provision will help business with cash flow. Expanding the carry back allows business owners to balance out net losses over years when the business has had a net operating gain. I am confident that each of these targeted measures will provide timely. effective incentives to spur spending and encourage new investment and job growth in the hundreds of thousands of small businesses that drive this Nations economy.
2013,"Mr. President. I wish to remember the trials faced by the Ukrainian people and to pay tribute to their fortitude and love of freedom. At times in its history. Ukraine has been exploited and suffered greatly under repressive occupations. The Stalinist regime of the former Soviet Union sought to maintain control of the people and resources of the Ukraine through vicious oppression. The Ukrainian people have weathered many trials. but they have always fought for their freedom. It is my belief that as we embrace Ukraines future. we must always remember the hardships of its past. The Ukrainian peasantry rebelled against the collectivization policies imposed on them by the Stalinist regime starting in 1925. It is documented that very few farmers voluntarily joined collectives until Soviet secret police and Bolshevik brigades were sent to crush the resistance. As agricultural production fell in 1932 due to drought and these Stalinist policies. the regime attempted to maintain its export level. To do this the regime brutally confiscated grain and foodstuffs from hungerstricken villages. Trade and supplies of food and goods were banned from those villages which were considered to be ""underperforming."" while families who resisted were banished to central Asia. The totalitarian regime meted out harsh sentences. even the death penalty. against those who stole even small amounts of grain. We can never forget that over 2.000 innocent people. including children as young as 12 years old. were executed under this law. In 1932. Stalin imposed barricades throughout the USSR to prevent peasants from fleeing those regions stricken by famine. It was a stateorganized program of mass starvation against the nation of Ukraine as a whole and the revived Ukrainian nationalism. It had been inflicted on them deliberately to punish Ukraine and destroy the basis of its nationhood. The faminegenocide of the Holodomor resulted in the tragic and unforgettable loss of millions of Ukrainian lives. Nevertheless. the Stalinist regime denied reports of mass deaths and forbade travel to the area to deter foreign journalists from reporting on these terrible crimes. In fact. these horrible crimes remained largely unknown to the broader world for decades as a result of the denials and coverups of the Soviet authorities and their refusal of offers of international aid. Through its determination to remember the victims of the famine and Soviet oppression. the Ukrainian American community has helped to bring these events to light. Their efforts have helped to give a voice to the millions of people who suffered. starved. and died as a result of a flawed policy and authoritarian regime. On the 75th anniversary of the Ukrainian faminegenocide. we must continue the important work of the Ukrainian American community by remembering the cruel injustices suffered by the Ukrainian people during that part of history. By so doing. we are not only honoring the millions of victims of this oppression. but we are helping to prevent a tragedy like this from happening again in the future."
2013,Mr. President. just over 1 month ago. in the days before the December 27 president election. I noted that it had become the closest political contest in that countrys history and that the two leading candidates were running robust. active campaigns. Although I also acknowledged the persistence of a deeply entrenched culture of corruption. I was encouraged by the growing engagement of Kenyan citizens and civil society organizations during the relatively peaceful. wellrun. and competitive campaign season. I joined many others in hoping that the presidential and parliamentary elections held on that day would confirm Kenyas place among the worlds most promising emerging economies and young democracies. Instead. that hope turned to dismay as we watched a blatant disregard for democratic principles and processes by the ruling party and an extraordinary disrespect for rule of law and human rights by both leading candidates parties. The serious allegations of vote rigging. the rushed declaration of a presidential winner. and the destructive violence that have ensued are not only hurting the Kenyan peoplethey are jeopardizing Kenyas previous democratic progress. With Somalia. Ethiopia. Sudan. and Uganda as neighbors in the volatile Horn of Africa. Kenya has long been regarded as a stable country making slow but persistent progress towards democracy. Kenyas press and courts seemed to be asserting their independence from the presidentdominated government. and the mere fact that all preelection opinion polls put the incumbent president neckandneck with his challenger from the main opposition party seemed to be an encouraging sign of a vibrant democracy. But on December 27 and in the days that followed. this progress came to a grinding halt. The Kenyan election suffered a fate all too common in Africa. with the votes tallied behind closed doors and the results finally announced by Kenyas Electoral Commission suggesting significant rigging. The resulting frustration and deadlock have sparked violence. looting. destruction of property. and disruption of normal activity. creating an economic and humanitarian emergency on top of the current political crisis. Hundreds have been killedsome of them because of disproportionate use of force by Kenyan police as they seek to quell protestsand tens of thousands have fled their homes. Trust in the government. law enforcement. and even in ones neighbor has been seriously undermined. The rival political leadersincumbent President Mwai Kibaki and leader of the Orange Democratic Movement opposition party. Raila Odingacan work to end this violence and destruction by refraining from using. inciting or condoning violent tactics. In recent days. Mr. Odinga and his supporters have demonstrated noteworthy restraint and it is essential that both parties respect the importance of a peaceful resolution as they begin to participate in an internationally brokered dialogue. led by former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan. It is early days yet. and it remains unclear how committed these leading candidates are to seeing the negotiation through to the finish line. Although he has agreed to participate in an internationally brokered meeting with Mr. Odinga. Mr. Kibaki has been less than cooperative by rushing to appoint his own cronies to top cabinet positions and declaring he will follow the recommendations only of the Kenyan courts. which are also packed with his supporters. A political settlement is a key element in working through this electoral crisis but it must be part of a greater initiative that includes institutional reform. The road ahead is long. and I remain concerned that while both leading candidates have come to the table for negotiations. they could still decide to abandon the effort. The past few weeks have shown how superficial Kenyas democratic gains may really have been. Now the international communityand the United States in particularmust live up to its rhetoric in favor of free and fair elections and institutional building. Many of the other countries that have suffered botched elections had a long history of such fraud but if this relatively stable and prosperous country is allowed to abandon its democratic experiment. the appeal of democracy will inevitably dim around the world. The citizens of Kenya as well as those from around the world had higher expectations for Kenya. Resolving Kenyas current political. humanitarian. and economic crisis will require a coordinated international effort to engage all players in identifying and addressing the deeper problems that allowed the election fraud to occur and to ignite such a wave of outrage. Although a powersharing agreement will likely be part of the solution. serious underlying problems need to be addressed. The challenges facing Kenya include an overconcentration of power in the office of the president. insufficient independence of the judiciary and electoral institutions. the need for professionalization of police and armed forces. and a persistent lack of transparency and inclusiveness throughout the political system. Only by addressing these root causes of the recent conflict will Kenya be able to truly restore stability and emerge from this crisis a stronger and more prosperous nation. Such a task will not be quick. easy. or cheap. but the alternativenot seizing this chance to bring about essential political reformwould be enduring. complex. and costly. Last week. along with my ranking member on the Senate Subcommittee on African Affairs. Senator SUNUNU. and Senators CARDIN and KERRY. I introduced a resolution to encourage the United States and the wider international community to resist the temptation for a quick fix in Kenya and to instead pursue a more intensive. encompassing plan for political t ransition and transformation. I hope the Senate will pass this resolution shortly. The administration has played an active rolesending Assistant Secretary Frazer to Nairobi shortly after the elections to meet with both leading candidatesand I know Ambassador Ranneberger has been actively engaged incountry. But we need to see greater collaboration from all donorswith one consistent message that helps move Kenya to the next stage. I hope that Members of Congress from both parties will come together to support this initiative and the diplomatic and humanitarian efforts in Kenya that must follow in the coming weeks and months. The U.S.-Kenya partnership is a longstanding and important one. but I cannot condone a continued relationship with a government that has apparently stolen an election and uses tactics of fear and intimidation to address dissent. This is not the Kenya I have come to know. and I am sure. not the Kenya its citizens want to know. We must close this devastating chapter by addressing the reasons for the electoral crisis and ensuing violence. Without such vital work. our historic partnership will deteriorate. There is a window of opportunity to ensure this does not happen. and I encourage all key actors to seize upon this opening. Above all. I want to see violence end and hope restored in Kenya.
2013,"Mr. President. I was necessarily absent for todays cloture votes on the RockefellerBond Substitute amendment No. 3911 and the Reid amendment No. 3918 to S. 2246. the FISA legislation. Had I been present. I would have voted ""no"" on No. 3911 and ""aye"" on No. 3918. I believe that now is the time for the full Senate to consider and debate the difficult questions raised in this legislation. The Senate should consider and vote on important amendments relating to the protection of Americans civil liberties and the question of immunity for telecommunications providers."
2013,"Mr. President. 75 years ago yesterday. the U.S. conducted the first nuclear test on American soilthe detonation of a onekiloton nuclear device in an area known as Frenchman Flat at the Nevada Test Site. Conducted in extraordinary secrecy. this first nuclear testing program. known as Project Nutmeg. was representative of the efforts of countless Americans in the 50 year struggle we know as the Cold War. Lasting half a century. the Cold War was the longest sustained conflict in U.S. history. The nuclear capabilities of our enemy posed literally an existential threat to our Nation. The threat of mass destruction left a permanent mark on American life. The U.S. prevailed over this grave threat. through the technological achievement. patriotism. and sacrifice of the people of the great State of Nevada. and of others throughout the Nation. It has been 18 years since the Malta Conference that marked the end of the Cold War. yet the contributions and sacrifices of generations of Americans have largely gone unrecognized. The time has come to recognize and honor those Americans who toiled in relative obscurity to bring us victory during this most dangerous conflict in our Nations history. Today I introduce a bill that requires the Department of the Interior to conduct a study to identify sites and resources to commemorate heroes of the Cold War. and to interpret the Cold War for future generations. My legislation directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a ""Cold War Advisory Committee"" to oversee the inventory of Cold War sites and resources. for potential inclusion in the National Park System. as national historic landmarks. or other appropriate designations. The Advisory Committee will work closely with State and local governments and local historical organizations. The Committees starting point will be a Cold War study completed by the Secretary of Defense under the 1991 Defense Appropriations Act. Obvious Cold War sites of significance include: intercontinental ballistic missile launch sites. flight training centers. communications and command centers. such as Cheyenne Mountain. Colorado. nuclear weapons test sites. such as the Nevada Test Site. and sites of other strategic and tactical significance. Perhaps no state in the union played a more sigificant role than Nevada in winning the Cold War. The Nevada Test Site is a hightechnology engineering marvel where the U.S. developed. tested. and perfected a nuclear deterrent that formed the cornerstone of Americas security and leadership among nations. Of the 1.149 nuclear detonations conducted by U.S. as part of its nuclear testing program. 1.021 were performed at the Nevada Test Site. The Naval Air Station at Fallon. NV. home of the Navys preeminent tactical air warfare training center. was also the site of Cold Warera nuclear testing. Hawthorne Army Depot. formerly known as the Hawthorne Army Ammunition Plant. likewise played an important role throughout the Cold War. serving as a staging area for conventional bombs. rockets. and ammunition as it had done since World War II. Nellis Air Force Base outside Las Vegas. home of the first dedicated air warfare and later air/ground training facility. provided to Cold War aviators and continues to provide advanced air combat training for U.S. and Allied forces. Generations of Nevadans bore and continue to bear extraordinary costs as a result of these critical contributions to the Cold War effort. The Advisory Committee established under this legislation will develop an interpretive handbook telling the story of the Cold War and its heroes. Id like to take a moment to relate a story of one group of Cold War heroes. On a snowy evening. November 17. 1955. a U.S. Air Force C54 cargo plane crashed near the summit of Mount Charleston in rural Nevada. Kept secret for years. we now know that the four aircrew and ten scientists aboard the doomed aircraft were bound for the secret Air Force Flight Test Center. where they were developing a topsecret spy plane that would become known as the U2. These men who gave their lives that day helped build the plane that many critics said could never be built. Owing to the efforts of men like these. the critics were proved wrong: the U2 remains a vital component of our reconnaissance forces to this day. As a result of the absolute secrecy surrounding their work. the families of the men who perished on Mount Charleston only recently learned the true circumstances of the crash that took the lives of their loved ones and the nature of their vital work. This legislation will provide $500.000 to identify historic landmarks. like the Mount Charleston crash site. to recognize and pay tribute to the sacrifices of these men and others. I would like to reiterate my thanks for Mr. Steve Ririe of Las Vegas. whose tireless efforts brought to light the events surrounding the death of these fourteen men on Mount Charleston over fifty years ago. and for the efforts of State Senator Raymond Rawson. who shepherded through the Nevada legislature a resolution honoring these heroes. A grateful Nation owes a debt of supreme gratitude to the silent heroes of the Cold War. I urge my colleagues to support this longoverdue tribute to the contribution and sacrifice of these Americans. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the RECORD."
2013,"Mr. President. on December 31. the United Nations and the African Union jointly assumed control of the peacekeeping mission in Darfur. But. sadly. little has changed for the people of Darfur. The United Nations Security Council has authorized over 26.000 peacekeepers. but just over 9.000 are.on the ground in Darfur. The government of Sudan had promised to abide by the United Nations resolution. but it continues to obstructit at almost every turn. Some of the rebel leaders have begun to join in coalitions with one another. an important step for the peace process. but others continue to prey on civilians and humanitarian aid workers and to threaten peacekeepers. And the nations of the world had pledged to help end the genocide. but they are falling short where it counts. U.N. Secretary General Ban Kimoon reports that no one has stepped up to provide the 24 helicopters that are needed to transport and protect the peacekeepers and to give them the mobility that they need to do their jobs. That is inexcusable. We cannot allow genocide and suffering to continue because the combined nations of the world cannot find 24 helicopters to help stop it. That is why today. joined by Senator LUGAR and a number of other colleagues. I have introduced a resolution expressing the Sense of the Senate that the world must not allow this peacekeeping mission to founder because we cannot find 24 suitable aircraft within our vast arsenals. I recognize that helicopters are expensive vehicles that are in short supply. with wars raging in Afghanistan and Iraq and with peacekeeping missions in the Congo and now being deployed to Chad as well. But a considerable number of nations possess aerial vehicles with the capabilities that are needed for this mission. Together. we could fill this gap. The United Nations is seeking 18 utility and 6 tactical helicopters. According to a piece in the Washington Post. the member nations of NATO alone possess over 18.000 helicopters. Not all of these 18.000 aircraft would be suitable for this mission. NATO reserves are taxed in Afghanistan and elsewhere. but the potential vehicles certainly exist. NATO is not alone in this capability. Other countries could also step up to fill this need. Secretary General Ban has stated that these vehicles are indispensable. He reports that the United NationsAfrican Union mission must ""be capable of rapid mobility over large distances. especially over terrain where roads are the exception."" Ban also said that ""Without the missing helicopters. this mobilitya fundamental requirement for the implementation of the [Security Councils] mandatewill not be possible."" Helicopters alone will not save Darfur. The needs there are immense and growing. The United Nations revealed last month that acute malnutrition in the region is rising and surpassing emergency levels in some areas. To make matters worse. the Government of Khartoum is continuing to obstruct deployment of U.N. peacekeepers. They have objected to nonAfrican peacekeepers. such as a team of Norwegian engineers. and they are slowing deployment by denying visas and land permits and denying night flights. Most seriously of all. earlier this month. Sudanese troops opened fire on a clearly marked U.N. convoy. badly injuring a driver. The world must not allow the Khartoum government to dictate terms to the UN mission. The European Union and United Nations Security Council should. I believe. join the United States in imposing strong economic sanctions on the Sudanese government. We should also continue to pressure the rebel groups to cease all attacks on civilians and humanitarian workers and engage in a peace process to bring a real solution for the people of Darfur. We should do all these things and more. but. first and foremost. we should ensure that the United Nations and African Union have the tools that they need to carry out their mission. The United States has already provided more than $4.5 billion since 2004 in response to the Darfur crisis. That is an enormous contribution and it should not fall on our shoulders to fill this particular gap in the peacekeeping mission. That is why I have repeatedly written President Bush asking him to use the powers of persuasion of his office to personally contact other heads of state to ask them to commit the needed vehicles and crews. I have also written the Secretary General of NATO and President Hu of China. asking them to help fill this gap. Our resolution urges the members of the international community with the necessary assets to contribute the needed vehicles and crews. Preventing genocide is a global responsibility. Too often the world has failed to keep this commitment. and it has failed Darfur for too long. We cannot allow the government of Khartoum to block deployment of the 26.000 peacekeepers. but it would perhaps be even more unforgivable if the international community refuses to provide the peacekeepers with the equipment and vehicles that they need. Then we will have done Khartoums job for them by obstructing ourselves."
2013,"Mr. President. I would like to inform Members that the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship will hold a hearing entitled ""Holding the Small Business Administration Accountable: Womens Contracting and Lender Oversight."" on Wednesday. January 30. 2008. at 10 a.m.. in room 428A of the Russell Senate Office Building."
2013,Mr. President. on behalf of Senator INOUYE. I ask unanimous consent that floor privileges be granted for the remainder of the 110th Congress to Robin Squellati. a detailee from the U.S. Air Force Nurse Corps who works with his staff on issues pertaining to a number of different issues over which Senator INOUYE has some responsibility.
2013,Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that Augustine Ripa. a legal intern in my Judiciary Committee office. be granted floor privileges for the remainder of the Senates consideration of the pending FISA legislation.
2013,Mr. President. on behalf of the leader. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in recess until 8:20 p.m.. and that at 8:30 p.m.. the Senate proceed as a body to the Hall of the House of Representatives to receive the Presidents State of the Union Address. that upon the dissolution of the joint session. the Senate adjourn until 10 a.m.. Tuesday. January 29. I further ask that following the prayer and the pledge. the Journal of proceedings be approved to date. the morning hour be deemed expired. the time for the two leaders be reserved. and that there then be a period of morning business for up to 1 hour. with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each. with the time equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees. with the Republican leader controlling the first half and the majority leader controlling the final half. that following morning business. the Senate resume consideration of Calendar No. 512. S. 2248. the FISA legislation. and that the Senate stand in recess from 12:30 until 2:15 to allow for the weekly caucus luncheons to meet.
2013,Mr. President. if there is no further business to come before the Senate. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in recess under the previous order.
2013,Madam President. I move to reconsider the vote on which cloture was not invoked on the RockefellerBond substitute amendment and move to lay that motion on the table.
2013,I suggest the absence of a quorum.
2013,Madam President. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.
2013,Mr. Speaker. later this week Congress will return to the issue of how best to modernize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. In November in this House of Representatives. we passed a very good bill. We would do well to observe the principles established in that bill. Any final review of domestic surveillance passed by Congress should include court review of executive branch actions. The reason for this requirement is quite simple. Having a legal standard of review provides us both better intelligence and better civil liberty protections for our people. It is simple. It has been demonstrated that when officials must establish before an independent court that they know what they are doing. that they have reason to intercept communications. we get better intelligence. And. of course. thats the point. to have the intelligence to protect the American people from indiscriminate collection and fishing expeditions. Those are not productive. In November. we passed a bill that would do this. the RESTORE Act. That bill guarantees court review of executive branch actions related to surveillance activities. I would commend that bill to this House.
2013,Mr. Speaker. I rise today to thank the bipartisan leadership and the White House for including a bonus depreciation provision in the proposed economic stimulus package. Currently. the package we plan to vote on tomorrow will include a 50 percent bonus depreciation for the first year for certain machinery and equipment purchases. This increase in bonus depreciation was included in the Jobs Tax Relief Act of 2003 and contributed to the productivity of small businesses. a boost in job creation. and a steady rise in the growth of the economy over the last 5 years. This incentive for small businesses enables them to compete with foreign competitors. The best way to weather this current economic storm is to build on the principles that have made our economy the envy of the world. That means lower taxes. less government regulation. and economic incentives for American businesses. We should promote the concept that the people should keep their own money which they know how to spend best as explained by editor Jerry Bellune of the Lexington County Chronicle. Jankuary 28. 2008 In conclusion. God bless our troops. and we will never forget September the llth.
2013,Mr. Speaker. I know we are going to be looking at economic stimulus packages. and we are going to be trying to jumpstart and help our economy. It is my belief that one way that we can do that is to make sure that we provide a jobs training program for the 1 million young people across the country who dont have any money. no job. no employment. many of them are out of school. Lets consider a job training program for our young people as a part of the economic stimulus package.
2013,Mr. Speaker. the gloom. doom. and depressed say the economy is in trouble. The naysayers solution is a big government bailout. Since Uncle Sam has apparently spent the money brought in by income taxpayers. he will just borrow $150 billion and give it away to Americans. many of whom dont even pay income tax. The idea is that Americans will rush out and spend the free money and that will allegedly help the economy. But the last time the Feds gave away money. 75 percent of the recipients paid off personal debt rather than go shopping at the mall. And where is Uncle Sam going to borrow $150 billion? Probably from Communist China. who already owns much of our debt. You know. the country that sells toys to America that contain lead. How does borrowing billions with interest expecting our kids to pay off our debt make us better off? The big spending gimmick has all of the earmarks of vote pandering. No individual or country can spend money it doesnt have and then blissfully claim economic victory. And thats just the way it is.
2013,Mr. Speaker. tonight we expect to hear President Bushs last State of the Union address to this Congress. I hope that the recent days working together with this Congress on a bipartisan economic stimulus package can be a good model for the rest of this year and the rest of this Presidents term. We want to extend a hand to work with him when we can. and this is a good example of how we can do it. But if we see continued roadblocks to progress in this country. we must work to break those roadblocks down and continue to work restoring fiscal responsibility in our government. changing course in Iraq. preparing to address global climate change. addressing the military readiness crisis in this country. and restoring Americas moral leadership in the world. I believe we can and we must continue to work together for the great needs of this country. I hope we can continue to do that for the rest of this session.
2013,"Mr. Speaker. I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 10799 West Alameda Avenue in Lakewood. Colorado. as the ""Felix Sparks Post Office Building""."
2013,Mr. Speaker. I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.
2013,Mr. Speaker. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Colorado
2013,"Mr. Speaker. I thank the gentleman from Illinois. I rise today to pay tribute and say thank you to a Colorado icon and an American hero. Felix Sparks. with H.R. Sparks. who recently passed away at the age of 90. lived an extraordinary life that exemplified public service and devotion to ones country. A Texas native raised in Arizona. Felix Sparks was a part of our ""Greatest Generation"" who answered our Nations call to duty during the Second World War. Described as a ""soldiers soldier."" he would endure over 500 days of combat and partake in three of the most important events that would define modern history. The Battle of Reipertswiller. the Battle at the Caves of Anzio. and the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp. One story in particular that I would like to call to your attention which attests to the character of Felix Sparks occurred during the Battle of Reipertswiller. a battle in which 158 enlisted soldiers were killed. 300 men were wounded. and another 426 were captured over a course of only 3 days. After finding his unit under siege and trapped in enemy territory. Sparks. then a lieutenant colonel. refused to leave behind three of his men who lay incapacitated in the open battlefield. Facing nearcertain death. he courageously left his tank and raced. on foot. directly into the closerange crosshairs of the German gunners to rescue those soldiers. With only a holstered pistol in tow. he would drag each of his wounded comrades. one by one. to safety. A personal account of this series of events was uncovered in the memoirs of a German SS officer who had commanded his gunner not to fire on Sparks. The memoir read: ""Those of us witnessing the scene. whether nearby or more distant. instinctively felt there was no honor to be won by firing on this deathdefying act of comradeship."" Sparks also cheated death a year earlier at the Battle of the Caves of Anzio in Italy. where he would be only one of two men in his company to survive. Sparks was part of the first Allied force to witness the horrors and atrocities of the Dachau concentration camp on the discovery of 39 rail cars packed with some 2.000 Holocaust victims. In all. 30.000 prisoners were liberated from Dachau by the Allied Forces. and for the rest of his life. Sparks would continue to speak out at Holocaust remembrance ceremonies. Based on his experiences at Dachau. Felix was tireless in his efforts to refute those shameless individuals who try to rewrite history and claim the Holocaust and Dachau never occurred. Hed say: ""Tell that to my face"" in a shout and in a voice that indicated hed been there and saw it personally. For his service during World War II. he was awarded a Silver Star and two Purple Hearts after being severely wounded on the battlefield. He would continue his military service with the National Guard until his retirement as a brigadier general in 1977. And upon his return from the war. enamored with stories from his men about their hometowns in the Rocky Mountains. Felix and his wife settled in Colorado. There. the Sparks family would grow to include four children. six grandchildren. and seven great grandchildren. He would earn his law degree from the University of Colorado and become a Colorado district attorney. Renowned for his commanding speaking ability. Felix would then go on to become the youngest supreme court justice in Colorados history at just 38 years of age. He would preside over several of the most prolific and high profile cases in our States history. After his service on our States highest court. Sparks. an expert in water law. would serve for over two decades as the director of the Colorado Water Conservation Board. He would write some of the most influential and important groundwater laws that have continued to serve our State for decades thereafter. I came to know Felix during my days in the Colorado senate after he had testified in my committee with regard to an antigun violence measure following the tragic death of his grandchild from a driveby shooting. His passion and his words live with me to this day. And he was so well respected for his honesty and straightforward testimony. It is also important to note. after returning home from the war. Felix would continue to personally reach out to console the families of his men and promise them he would never forget. Mr. Speaker. one of the main reasons I bring this bill to the floor today is so this promise that Felix Sparks made to the families of his men can live on for generations. This bill pays tribute to Felixs men in the 157th Infantry Regiment of the 45th Infantry Division of the United States Army. whose motto since the SpanishAmerican War has been ""Eager for Duty."" Our Nation can never adequately repay and give thanks to these individuals for their sacrifices in the battles against tyranny. in the battles for our Nations freedom. It is my hope the renaming of the Lakewood post office for Felix Sparks will inspire future generations to find a calling in public service. This bill also pays tribute to Mary Sparks and the Sparks family. who meant so much to Felix and to our community. In closing. I wish to thank each of my colleagues in the Colorado delegation for joining me in bidding a fond farewell to a man who meant so much to our State and to our Nation. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 4240 to rename the Lakewood post office in Felix Sparks honor."
2013,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. I rise today to honor the memory of a great American. Felix Sparks. who recently passed away at the age of 90. Mr. Sparks commitment to our country began in 1940 when he joined the 157th Infantry Regiment of the 45th Division. He would go on to fight bravely in World War H. earning a Silver Star and two Purple Hearts. During the war. he even helped liberate 30.000 people from the infamous Dachau concentration camp. Upon returning to the States. Felix and his wife. Mary. settled in Colorado. Still wanting to continue his service to our country. he then joined the National Guard. He would remain active in the Guard until 1970. when he retired as a brigadier general. Besides his exemplary military service record. Mr. Sparks also excelled as a civilian. He had a brilliant legal mind. This was reflected in his appointment to the supreme court of Colorado at the age of 38. making him the youngest justice in the States history. His expertise was water law. which he applied as director of the Colorado Water Conservation Board for over two decades. Considering his years of selfless public service to his State and to his country. I believe it is a fitting tribute to name a post office in Colorado in his honor. Hopefully. his life will serve as an example to others to follow. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
2013,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself such time as I might consume. Mr. Speaker. as a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Im pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 4240. which names a postal facility in Lakewood. Colorado. after Felix Sparks. H.R. 4240. which was introduced by Representative PERLMUTTER on November 15. 2007. was reported from the Oversight Committee on December 12. 2007. by voice vote. The measure has the support of the entire Colorado congressional delegation and provides us with yet another opportunity to pay tribute to an extraordinary American citizen. Felix Sparks served his country proudly as a World War II Army brigadier and served his community diligently as a member of the Colorado supreme court. For his service in World War H. Mr. Sparks was awarded a Silver Star and two Purple Hearts after being wounded on the battlefield. Additionally. for over 20 years. Mr. Sparks worked to protect and improve the environment in the great State of Colorado by serving as director of Colorados Water Conservation Board. Mr. Speaker. given Mr. Sparks contribution to Colorado. and to America in general. he deserves to be commended. Therefore. I would urge swift passage of this bill. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
2013,Mr. Speaker. I dont have any other speakers. but I want to urge all Members to support the passage of H.R. 4240. the naming of this post office for this great American hero. Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.
2013,Mr. Speaker. I have no further speakers and would urge passage. I yield back the balance of my time.
2013,"Mr. Speaker. I move to suspend the rules and pass the Senate bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 427 North Street in Taft. California. as the ""Larry S. Pierce Post Office""."
2013,Mr. Speaker. I would ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.
2013,Mr. Speaker. I now yield myself such time as I might consume. As a member of the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight. Im pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of S. 2110. which names the postal facility in the town of Taft. California. after Larry S. Pierce. S. 2110. which was introduced in the Senate by Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN Of California on September 27. 2007. and passed by the Chamber with unanimous consent on November 16. 2007. was considered and reported out of the Oversight Committee by voice vote on December 12. 2007. Mr. Speaker. the bill before us seeks to pay tribute to a great American serviceman by requesting that the postal facility in Taft. California. be renamed in honor of Staff Sergeant Larry Pierce. who lost his life at the young age of 24 while fighting for our country in the Vietnam War. A recipient of the Medal of Honor. Staff Sergeant Pierce stands as a reminder to us all of the great sacrifice our men and women in uniform are making on a daily basis to protect America. And so. Mr. Speaker. I join with my colleagues from California in recognizing the contributions of Staff Sergeant Larry S. Pierce and urge swift passage of this bill. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
2013,Mr. Speaker. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. I rise today to honor the memory of Army Staff Sergeant Larry Pierce. a true American hero. Larry Pierce was raised in Taft. California. He would have graduated from Taft Union High School in 1959. but he chose to enlist in the Army in 1958. Seven years later. having achieved the rank of staff sergeant. Larry found himself in Vietnam as the squad leader of a reconnaissance platoon. On September 20. 1965. his squad was on patrol when it was ambushed by hostile forces. Thanks to Staff Sergeant Pierces leadership and courage. the squad successfully repelled the attack. driving the enemy away. While in pursuit of the enemy. Pierces squad came across a dirt road. It was on this road Sergeant Pierce discovered an antipersonnel mine. Knowing it would destroy the majority of his squad who was not aware of its presence. Sergeant Pierce threw himself completely on top of the mine. In this act of unbelievable bravery. Sergeant Pierce saved the lives of all his squad. while sacrificing his own. For his actions he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. He left behind a wife and three children. Sergeant Pierce represents the very best in the tradition of service and selflessness of our Armed Forces. It is fitting that we name this post office in his hometown of Taft. California. in his honor. Surely. his story can live as an example of what it truly means to be a hero. Mr. Speaker. I reserve the balance of my time.
2013,Mr. Speaker. I would continue to reserve.
2013,Mr. Speaker. at this time I would like to recognize the author of the companion bill that was dropped here in the House. the distinguished colleague of mine from California for as much time as he may consume. f 1430
2013,"Mr. Speaker. I rise today in strong support of the legislation. S. 2110. to designate the United States Post Office located at 427 North Street in Taft. California. as the Larry S. Pierce Post Office. the true hometown hero. U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Pierce was born in Oklahoma in 1941. As a young child. his family moved to Taft. California. which I represent today. Sergeant Pierce attended Taft city schools and would have graduated from Taft Union High School with the class of 1959 but decided to serve his country by joining the U.S. Army in 1958. Sergeant Pierce served in the 1st Battalion Airborne. 503rd Infantry and the 173rd Airborne Brigade in the Vietnam War. On September 20. 1965. near Ben Cat in Vietnam. Sergeant Pierce was leading his reconnaissance platoon. was ambushed by hostile forces. Sergeant Pierce and his squad successfully routed the hostile forces from their location. During pursuit of this enemy. Sergeant Pierce heroically sacrificed his own life to save his men. He came upon a road where they found a mine. He threw himself upon it knowing that if this mine went off. it would destroy many and take many lives of his own men. Upon hearing of this and upon his death. in February of 1966 President Lyndon B. Johnson awarded Sergeant Pierce the Medal of Honor. In this award. he went on to say for his ""inspiring leadership and personal courage."" and his ""profound concern for his fellow soldiers."" acting with ""extraordinary heroism. at the cost of his life"" and to ""great credit upon himself and the Armed Forces of his country."" Sergeant Pierce would have been 66 years old this year. He is survived by his wife. Verlin. who currently lives in Bakersfield. California. his children. Teresa. Kelley and Gregory. This legislation is a fitting honor for a Vietnam War veteran who sacrificed his life to save the lives of fellow soldiers by naming the post office in his hometown of Taft in his memory. I do want to thank Senator FEINSTEIN for introducing this legislation and for working with me. Taft is a place where Senator FEINSTEINS own father worked. She knows of the work of Sergeant Larry Pierce. the hometown hero. as many have gone on to say. Mr. Speaker. I include for the RECORD a copy of Staff Sergeant Larry Pierces Medal of Honor and a copy of the Taft City Council letter of support and resolution requesting the post office in his name."
2013,Mr. Speaker. I continue to reserve.
2013,Mr. Speaker. at this time I have no further speakers. and I urge all Members to support the passage of S. 2110. I yield back the balance of my time.
2014,Mr. Speaker. there has been a gentleman who chairs the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations who has been at the forefront of making sure that health care is provided in a timely fashion to our veterans. somebody who himself is a combat veteran. I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado
2014,"Mr. Speaker. as a gulf war and Iraq war veteran. I am grateful for the leadership of the gentleman from Florida. Chairman MILLER. on the House Committee on Veterans Affairs and for his support of H.R. 4261. H.R. 4261. the Gulf War Health Research Reform Act of 2014. which I sponsored along with Ranking Member KIRKpatrick and full committee Ranking Member MICHAUD. restores the independence of the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans Illnesses to perform the role it has historically played. as intended by Congress. to improve the lives of ill gulf war veterans. This bill is necessary because some career VA staff have been trying to revive the discredited 1990s fiction that nothing special happened to gulf war veterans health and that the problems experienced by gulf war veterans are just ""what happens after every war"" due to psychological stress factors. Because there is no scientific evidence for this position. VA staffers have resorted to manipulating research studies and reports to try and revive this discredited theory. A major new VA gulf war veteran survey. for example. included the questions necessary to identify PTSD but not Gulf War illness. Most shockingly. VA has even manipulated new research of the Institute of Medicine by limiting the terms of its contracts. VA transformed the Institute of Medicine gulf war treatments study ordered by Congress into a report based largely on psychotherapies. The Research Advisory Committee objected strongly to these actions. which threatened to mislead treatment research just as science is finally turning the corner. VA retaliated by eliminating the independence of the committee. changing its charter to remove its authority to review the effectiveness of government research programs. and replacing the members serving on the committee. The effect of these changes can already be seen. The section of the new 2014 Research Advisory Committee report that detailed VAs manipulations of research had to be removed because the committees authority to review the effectiveness of VAs research programs had been eliminated. The independent voice. so critical to honest research. will be all but replaced by September with those who seem to bend to VAs will. H.R. 4261 will restore the authority of the committee and provide that its membership. instead of being appointed entirely by VA. will consist of nine members appointed by the chairs and ranking members of the House Veterans Affairs Committee. the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. and three members chosen by VA. This arrangement follows the longstanding model of the bipartisan Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance at the Department of Education. Current law provides that the Research Advisory Committee membership may include veterans. representatives of veterans. and the general public. While there are those who seek to limit veteran members to ill veterans. excluding most veterans service organization representatives and others. the Research Advisory Committee has been wellserved by having both ill and other veterans serve on the committee. It is important to remember that the unwillingness of the VA to honestly address this illness is the reason Congress created the Research Advisory Committee in the first place. The 1997 congressional report that led to that legislation was entitled. ""Gulf War Veterans Illnesses: VA. DOD Continue to Resist Strong Evidence Linking Toxic Causes to Chronic Health Effects."" Science has made great progress since then. thanks in no small measure to the work of the Research Advisory Committee. as well as to the effective Gulf War Illness Research Program that Congress created at the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs. But this progress is all at risk if VA is able to again mislead science down blind alleys. directing scarce research dollars at the wrong target. as so often happened in the 1990s and 2000s."
2014,I yield the gentleman an additional 112 minutes.
2014,"I thank the chairman. It is also important to ask why the VA has pursued this course. Last month. we learned the answer. On April 22. 2014. Military Times reported that the VA Under Secretary for Benefits. Allison Hickey. objected even to using the term ""Gulf War illness"" because it ""might imply a casual link between service in the gulf and poor health which could necessitate . . . disability compensation for veterans who served in the gulf."" Even if this policy was morally justifiable and saving money was the only goal. it is wrong. It will cost the Federal Government far less in the long run to face this problem honestly and pursue effective treatments. rather than to deny benefits and provide misleading research. We have strong support for this legislation from the Veterans of Foreign Wars. American Veterans. or AMVETS. and the Vietnam Veterans of America. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Without an independent Research Advisory Committee. the slow but steady progress toward identifying treatments for Gulf War illness will most surely end."
2014,Mr. Speaker. in closing. I just want to acknowledge the work of Mr. Jim Binns of Arizona. who has made countless trips back here advocating for this bill. I urge my colleagues to support it. We really need to do right by our gulf war veterans. With that. I yield back the balance of my time.
2014,Mr. Speaker. I urge all Members to support H.R. 4261. and I yield back the balance of my time.
2014,"Mr. Speaker. today. I rise with a heavy heart. On Friday night. my home community was rocked by unspeakable violence. which left six students and their assailant dead and 13 others injured. The rampage shook the communities of Isla Vista and the University of California in Santa Barbara. Californians. and the Nation. Last night. I joined with my community at UCSB and in Isla Vista to honor those we lost. Together. we have taken the first steps towards making sense of the senseless. It will be a long journey. We have many questions. and over the weeks and months ahead perhaps more will be posed than we can answer. But we will work through it together. While we all struggle to make sense of this tragedy. I want to thank you.

We pledge to stand with the Santa Barbara community. and all those touched by violence. to do all we can to prevent this sort of tragedy in the future. Mr. Speaker. I would now like to ask that the House observe a moment of silence for the victims. for their families. their friends. the UCSanta Barbara community. and all who mourn in the wake of this senseless tragedy."
2014,"Mr. Speaker. because of flight delays due to extreme weather I will not be present for tonights rollcall vote No. 241 and 242. Had I been present. I would have voted ""yes"" on rollcall vote No. 241 and ""yes"" on rollcall vote No. 242."
2014,"Mr. Speaker. on rollcalls No. 241 and No. 242 I did not cast my vote due to a weatherrelated flight delay. Had I been present. I would have voted ""yea"" on both."
2014,Mr. Speaker. I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill. H.R. 4660. and that I may include tabular material on the same.
2014,Madam Chair. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I am pleased to begin the consideration of H.R. 4660. making appropriations for fiscal year 2015 for Commerce. Justice. Science. and Related Agencies. This bill has a farreaching impact. from the safety of people in their homes and communities. to exploring the farthest reaches of space. The bill before the Committee today reflects a delicate balance of needs and requirements. We have drafted what I consider a responsible bill for FY 2015 spending levels for the departments and agencies under the subcommittees jurisdiction. We have had to carefully prioritize the funding in the bill and make hard choices about how to spend scarce resources. I want to thank Chairman ROGERS for supporting us with a very fair allocation and for helping us to move the bill forward. I want to thank the subcommittee ranking member. Mr. FATTAH. who has been a valued partner and colleague. I appreciate his commitment and his understanding of the wide variety of programs in this bill. and I thank him for his help. I want to thank all of the members of the subcommittee for their help and assistance and also thank Mrs. LOWEY. the ranking member of the full committee. I want to thank the majority staff for their hard worksubcommittee clerk Mike Ringler. Leslie Albright. Jeff Ashford. Diana Simpson. Colin Samples. and Taylor Kelly. I also appreciate the professionalism and cooperation of the minority staff. In particular. I want to thank Bob Bonner and Matt Smith for their help during all of the long hours spent putting this bill and report together. The bill totals $51.2 billion in discretionary spending. a reduction of $398 million. or approximately 1 percent below the current fiscal year. Since the beginning of the 112th Congress. the committee has cut the total amount of the CJS bill by $13.3 billion. or 20 percent. over five fiscal years. We have focused limited resources on the most critical areasfighting crime and terrorism. including a focus on preventing and investigating cyber attacks. and boosting U.S. competitiveness and job creation by investing in exports. manufacturing. science. and space exploration. For the Department of Commerce. the bill includes $8.4 billion. $391 million below the Presidents request. The bill provides funding above the request for the National Weather Service operations. weather research. and NOAAs two flagship weather satellite systems that will result in more timely and accurate warnings and forecasts. Severe weather events often result in the loss of life and economic ruin. We saw this again. recently. with devastating tornadoes in Arkansas. Mississippi. and elsewhere. These investments saved lives in Arkansas and Mississippi. and they will save lives wherever the next severe weather event strikes. The bill makes critical investments in manufacturing. export promotion. and job creation. including a Commerce Department task force to incentivize U.S. companies to bring their manufacturing and services activities back to the United States. The bill includes $856 million for NIST research and standards work that is critical to innovation and competitiveness. including $130 million for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program to help advance job growth in the manufacturing sector. It also funds the Cybersecurity Center of Excellence at NIST to work with companies to bolster cybersecurity in the retail sector and encourages the development of a cyber breach database. especially in light of the attacks on Target and Neiman Marcus. which impacted millions of Americans. A primary area of focus in the bill this year is scientific research. innovation. and competitiveness. Investing in basic research is key to growth and job creation. and it is the foundation for the economic security of future generations. which enables us to stay ahead of China. The bill includes $7.4 billion for the National Science Foundation. an increase of $232 million. or 3.2 percent. above FY14 for basic research and science. Despite the constrained allocation. this is an alltime high watermark for NSF basic research funding that will keep Americas economy strong by setting the groundwork for the development of new technologiesagain. not to be competitive with. but to stay ahead of the Peoples Republic of China. a Communist government. With increased funding comes increased responsibility. I respect the NSF to follow through on the commitments it has made to the committee to increase accountability and transparency in its grant decision making. No funny grants is what I am trying to say. The new director must take every necessary step to ensure that research grants are scientifically meritorious. that funding allocations reflect national priorities and that the taxpayer investments in science are being used wisely. Developing a welleducated STEM workforce is also critical to American competitiveness. More than $1 billion is provided throughout the bill for these efforts. including $876 million for NSF programs to improve the quality of science education. For NASA. the bill includes $17.9 billion. including funding above the request to keep the development schedule and flight milestones for the Orion crew vehicle and the Space Launch System. which will provide the capability for the U.S. to return to the Moon and to go to Mars. It is important for the U.S. to end our reliance on Russia for crew access to the International Space Station as soon as possible. which is why Commercial Crew Development is funded at $785 million. with instructions to NASA to find the fastest and safest way to close this gap. The bill includes an increase of $100 million for aeronautics research. a long overdue boost to this part of NASAs research portfolio. Aerospace is a pillar of the American manufacturing sector and is one of our leading exports. This investment will boost our aviation competitiveness and improve airspace safety. The Presidents request for NASA science programs would have inhibited progress on planetary science goals. including missions to Mars and Europa. This bill includes $5.2 billion for NASA Science. which restores those cuts. The bill also includes important resources to address critical security gaps throughout NASA. As the recent espionage case further demonstrated. countries like China are engaged in an unprecedented effort to steal cuttingedge technology from U.S. labs and companies. This includes the groundbreaking space and aeronautics research done at NASA every day. We need to make sure we are doing everything possible to prevent the theft or unauthorized disclosure of this technology. Last year. at the committees direction. a National Academy of Public Administration team. led by former Attorney General Dick Thornburgh. conducted an external review that found troubling vulnerabilities in NASAs security controls and practices. They found NASAs systems were compromised. and they found a troubling culture throughout the agency that failed to prioritize or to enforce security. Funding is included in this bill for NASA to protect its cuttingedge technology with improved IT security. export control training. additional counterintelligence staffing. and the operation of a new Foreign National Access Management program. The bill also calls for NASA to submit a followup report by the end of FY15 on NASAs progress in implementing the recommended improvements. The committee will continue to hold NASA accountable for the implementation of these security professions. For the Department of Justice. the bill includes $27.8 billion. $384 million above the current level. The top mission priority of the Justice Department is defending national security from both internal and external threats. The bill includes $8.5 billion. an increase of $125 million. for the FBIincluding funds to prevent and combat cyber intrusions. which Director Comey believes may overtake terrorism as the number one threat facing the Nation. Every major company in the United States has now been hit by the Chinese with cyber attacks. Many Members of Congress have had their computers stripped by the Chinese. The FBI continues to build a nationwide capability for cyber investigations. Last week. the Justice Department. for the first time. charged five officers of Chinas Peoples Liberation Army with economic cyber espionage. which is the first time foreign state actors have been so charged. I commend the administration. but in having served in the Army and in having been a privatea private never did anything a sergeant didnt tell him to do. the sergeant didnt do anything the lieutenant didnt tell him to do. the lieutenant didnt do anything that the major didnt tell him to doright up to the Commander in Chief. So this is not just five lowlevel Chinese officers. This goes to the highest level of the Chinese Government. This case is an example of the great work the men and women of the FBI are doing with these investments in this bill over the last several years to confront cyber attacks. and we thank the FBI. These efforts are necessary to stop the plundering of American innovation. jobs. and trade securities. The FBI is also at the forefront of the effort to combat violent gangs. This bill increases the funding for Safe Streets task forces to check this growing problem and to better support State and local law enforcement efforts to deal with gang networks in their communities. The bill includes $8.5 million for the National Gang Intelligence Center. and it gives the center a new name and an additional mission to provide and coordinate intelligence on human trafficking networks nationwide and to disseminate that intelligence to law enforcement partnerships. The Bureau of Prisons is responsible for the custody and care of more than 215.000 Federal offenders in 119 institutions nationwide. The bill includes $7 billion to ensure the safe and secure operation of the Federal Prison System. The bill continues funding for the Chuck Colson Task Force on Federal Corrections. When he got out of prison. Chuck Colson dedicated his life to reforming the prisons. so we have named this prison reform commission after Chuck Colson. which will recommend reforms to increase public safety. improve offender accountability. reduce recidivism. and control costs in the Federal Prison System. This effort will distill lessons learned from innovations at the State levelmany States are farther ahead. Texas is farther ahead. and many others are farther ahead than the Federal Bureau of Prisonsand enable these reforms to take hold in the Federal system and in corrections systems nationwide. The bill directs the Justice Departments Office for Victims of Crime to provide the survivors and families of the victims of the November 2009 terrorist attack at Fort Hood all possible and appropriate assistance. We are going to help the victims of Fort Hood and their families. We are going to require the office to report to Congress what. if any. role the classification of the attack as a workplace violence incident. rather than as a terrorist attack. played in determining what types of assistance would be provided. Awlaki was in touch with the major when he shot them. If you look at emails. this was a terrorist attack. It was not workplace violence. The bill includes a number of important provisions in support of Second Amendment rights. including a new provision prohibiting the implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty. by executive order or otherwise. The bill includes $2.1 billion for Justice grant programs that support States. localities. and nonprofits. This is a reduction of $73 million from the current level. In fact. since 2009. these programs have been reduced by 49 percent. I know we are going to get amendments here. complaining. but we had an allocation. and we had to work within that allocation. Despite the reduction. the bill prioritizes proven. highpriority programs. including Byrne Justice Assistance Grants. State Criminal Alien Assistance. Violence Against Women programs. human trafficking grants. and DNA backlog reduction. This is a significant bill for reducing violence against women and providing services to victims of domestic violence. sexual assault. and stalking. The bill includes $425.5 million for these programs. more than the current level and more than the Presidents request. This bill triples the current level for human trafficking task forces and victim services. We are determined to make a difference and bring an end to the heinous crime that is happening not only in other countries. but right here in the United States. So we triple the current levelnot just talk. not just rhetoric. wordswe triple the amount. and every FBI office is involved. and every U.S. attorney has to have a task force to see if we can actually end this. perhaps. in the same way that William Wilberforce ended the slave trade. It also directs the Attorney General to hold a national conference on sex trafficking with every Governor. with every U.S. attorney. and Federal. State. and local law enforcement to elevate awareness and to share the very best practice. What is going on in Texas can be done in Virginia. What is going on in Pennsylvania can be done somewhere else. At this national conference. they will all be together with the idea of ending this. The unacceptable backlog of DNA tests at crime labs and law enforcement agencies demands action. This bill includes $125 million for existing DNA programs and an additional $36 million to address the backlog of sexual assault kits at law enforcement agencies nationwide. The bill includes funding for prescription drug monitoring grants. thanks to Chairman ROGERS. It also includes a significant increase for the DEAs Tactical Diversion Squads to address our Nations fastest growing drug problemprescription drug abuse. Finally. after the Virginia Tech shootings in 2007. Congress passed a bill to improve the National Instant Background Check System. NICS. which is a critical tool for keeping firearms out of the hands of prohibited persons. but NICS is only as effective as is the State database on which it relies. The bill. for the second straight year. includes funding above the request for grants to States to improve NICS records. This bill includes $58.8 million. an increase of 6 percent above the Presidents request. and $40 million above the FY13 level. The bill also includes $2 million for the National Center for Campus Public Safety. which the committee established with the support of the Virginia Tech Family Foundation. This center serves as a clearinghouse for the dissemination of information and best practices. There was no money requested for this. but we wanted to fund it. Additionally. the bill includes $75 million for the Comprehensive School Safety Initiative. The National Institute of Justice will study the role of mental health. as well as exposure to violent mediasuch as video games and violent moviesin school violence at the K12 level. The initiative also provides pilot grants to test effective mental health interventions at schools across the Nation. NSF is also active in this area. They are currently seeking proposals that will enable a better understanding of the factors. causes. and consequences of youth violence. That is a summary of the bill before you today. It provides for the increases and cuts that were necessary. It carries on the fight against terrorism. cyberattacks. crime. trafficking in persons. and violence against women. and provides important increases to boost scientific research. innovation. and competitiveness. It provides strong support for all the various NASA missions and continues the effort to improve weather forecasting accuracy. It represents our best take on matching needs with scarce resources. We have tried hard to produce the best bill we possibly could within the resources we had to work with. I urge all Members to support this bill. and I reserve the balance of my time. (Amounts in thousands)
2014,Madam Chair. I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise to offer to the House our support for the base bill. The chairman of this committee. whom I have had the honor to work with for a number of years. has laid out in some detail some of the appropriations in this bill. And as our Constitution requires. no dollar out of our Treasury shall be appropriated. except by act of Congress. So we are here in our constitutional roles. I want to thank Chairman WOLF for all of the courtesies extended to the minority. Obviously. if we were drafting a bill. we might have a different set of numbers in different areas. whether for legal services or COPS. But in the main. this is a bill that the chairman has extended himself in every effort that could be done to accommodate the minority. I want to thank him for his work with me over these many years. inasmuch as this will be the last bill that he will carry on the floor. This bill. I think. represents a set of priorities important to our Nation that he has laid a predicate for that will be carried on even by others who may assume the role that he sits in today. As for the Democrats. I want to say a number of things. One is that we are very pleased that in this bill the science accounts have been a focus of high priority. For NASA. over $17 billion. For the National Science Foundation. $7.4 billion. As has been indicated. it is the highest amount to date. The Office of Science and Technology is fully funded at the Presidents request. I think some of us know now that I consider the science activities in this bill to be very. very important. In particular. superior among equals in terms of sciencerelated activities is neuroscience. Here. again. you will see an extraordinarily significant increase. It is one of the highest increases in any of the science accounts. The World Health Organization says well over a billion people are suffering from brainrelated diseases and disorders. The National Institutes of Health says that 50 million Americans suffer from dementia and epilepsy and all manner of neurologicalbased diseases and disorders. In this bill. we continue to fund a neuroscience initiative that was craftedand the chairman supported me in this effortin our very first bill. We continue to lay important foundations for the effort to actually come to grips with some of these challenges. So I am very pleased about that. On the manufacturing initiatives. the manufacturing extension partnership is very important. Today. we lead the world in manufacturing. Our lead that was absolute is now relative. We see other countries who are moving aggressively in this field. The chairman led an initiative in terms of reshoring these jobs. I have focused on trying to bring in more technology into our manufacturing plants. But the two of us share a concern that America has to be a country where we make things and where the manufacturing sector is secure in terms of being an important part of our economys future. I want to also mention the focus here on youth mentoring. It is above the Presidents request. This includes groups such as the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. which is a congressionally chartered organization serving some 4 million young people. Big Brothers Big Sisters. and Girls. Inc. We could go through the list. These are national evidencebased organizations that are really making a difference in the lives of young people. And the committee is aware of the great work that these organizations are doing. So we have seen fitand appropriately sowith the chairmans support. to raise the appropriations in this regard even above the Presidents request. So there will be a number of amendments that we will debate. Democrats may have a different opinion on some of these items from our colleagues on the other team. There may even be circumstances where there will be intramural differences on some of these issues. At its base. I think the CJS bill we present today reflects the Nations priorities. Obviously. if we had a larger allocation. we would invest even more in a variety of these priorities. I think some of the points that the chairman has pointed to in terms of human trafficking and aeronautics investments. on the manufacturing side. there are a number of areas where you can see clearly that the chairman has taken extraordinary care to make sure that a number of items get the appropriate revenues that are needed so that we can truly make a difference. So we are anxious to have the debate and to get to the amendments and have the House work its will. I want to thank the majority as we come here today. We have an open rule so the House will have an opportunity to work its will. Madam Chair. I reserve the balance of my time.
2014,Mr. Chairman. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Kentucky . chairman of the full committee.
2014,Thank you. Mr. Chairman. for yielding the time. Madam Chairman. I rise in support of this bill. I want to congratulate and thank Chairman WOLF and Mr. FATTAH. the ranking member. especially. and all the members of the subcommittee and staff for bringing us a bill that I think we can be proud of and support entirely. This is the third of the 12 appropriations bills that make up our workand this is the third that we have brought to the floor this year. I think this bill. like the other two that passed. deserves our support. We are moving at a very fast clip in the committee. That should allow us to complete our appropriations work for the 2015 fiscal year on time. I promise that my committee will do everything it can to make that a reality. As Chairman WOLF has said. the bill provides $51.2 billion for the Department of Justice. the Department of Commerce. NASA. the National Science Foundation. and related agencies. This very thorough piece of legislation. which was approved by the committee on a bipartisan basis. makes clear our priorities of keeping our Nation safe and growing our economy. To achieve these goals. the committee has targeted precious tax dollars toward those programs with proven results and economic benefit. For example. they increase the funding for the Department of Justice by $383 million over last year. Within that total. the bill targets FBI funding toward counterterrorism programs and programs that fight cyber intrusion. gangs. and human trafficking. We also work to fight drug trafficking by providing the DEA with $2.4 billion. That includes $367 million to combat prescription drug abuse. which has quickly become our Nations number one drug threat. Prescription drugs abuse is described by the Centers for Disease Control as a national epidemic. The funding in this bill will also help to protect communities across the country from the risks of devastating natural disasters. We rejected the Presidents proposed cuts to the National Weather Service and have made sure that adequate funding is provided for hurricane forecasting and tsunami warning grants. We have also made investments in the future of weather forecasting technology. In addition to the efforts in the bill to keep the Nation safe. we have also funded programs that will help our Nation prosper. Within the National Science Foundation and the Department of Commerce. the bill invests in programs that foster innovation and boost our economic competitiveness. This includes funding for programs that conduct research on manufacturing. cybersecurity. neuroscience. and STEM education. as well as $5 million in grant funding to encourage the repatriation of overseas jobs. But. as my committee will do with every bill we bring to the floor this year. we have ensured that this funding is responsible. is reasonable. and will make the most out of every single tax dollar spent. By scouring out waste and trimming unnecessary or lowerpriority spending. we have produced a bill that comes in nearly $400 million below the current year. I would like to note that the committee did this in spite of the Presidents request. which had $800 million in false savings and offsets and underfunded a variety of critical programs. This bill rejects those gimmicks and makes sure that these programs have received funding levels that allow them to do their important work. To make sure this good work does not fall to the wayside. the committee included several oversight provisions that will ensure our tax dollars are being spent responsibly. In addition. the bill includes several provisions that will assure the life. liberty. and property of the American people. such as prohibiting the transfer or release of Guantanamo detainees into the U.S.. protecting our Second Amendment rights. and preserving the sanctity of life. Madam Chairman. before I close. let me take a moment to again thank the chairman. FRANK WOLF. Mr. FATTAH. and members of the committee and staff for all their hard work on this bill. This is a tough bill to put together. and the allocation they had to work with was not the greatest in the world. But they have. I think. fit the needs of the country into this bill. I want to particularly draw attention to the chairman of this subcommittee and the author of this fine piece of legislation. FRANK WOLF has served in this House the same number of days that I have. We came together in January 1981. Over that 34 years of service in this body. Chairman FRANK WOLF has been a stalwart. passionate. compassionate legislator. and a dedicated. conscientious Member of Congress and appropriator. His expert work on this committee can be summed up in the legislation that we have before us today. I know that when he is gone. FRANK WOLFs absence will be deeply felt by me. all of his colleagues. and I think by the country. because he has truly served America for all these years unselfishly and with hard work and with compassion. So. Chairman WOLF. for all you have done for this bill. the Appropriations Committee. the House of Representatives. your native Virginia and the United States of America. we thank you. and we will miss you. With that. Madam Chairman. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
2014,Madam Chair. I yield as much time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from the great State of New York . the ranking member for the Democratic team on Appropriations.
2014,"Madam Chair. the Fiscal Year 2015 CommerceJusticeScience bill before us today provides good funding levels for important programs to support public safety. such as Byrne Justice Assistance Grants and Violence Against Women Act services. I thank Chairman WOLF for working with me to include report language directing the FBI to publish annual reports on the types of records submitted by each State and Federal agency to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. It is only as useful as the information it includes. and these reports will help improve the system. Chairman WOLF and Ranking Member FATTAH should be commended for fully funding the Office of Science and Technology Policy. including its working group on Neuroscience. as well as an increase of $21.5 million for National Science Foundations BRAIN Initiative. Investments in research and development grow our economy and help to ensure that future scientific breakthroughs happen in American labs. not those overseas. In addition. I am extremely pleased that this bill will provide $125 million for the DNA Initiative. as well as $36 million for a new community backlog reduction program to process sexual assault kits which. currently. are often untested for yearssometimes decadeswhen information contained in these kits could help put violent criminals behind bars. However. I continue to be baffled by efforts aimed at limiting the ability of the Federal Government to keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous individuals. An illadvised and dangerous amendment was included during the markup to make it more difficult for the ATF in four Southwest border States to be aware of multiple purchases of powerful semiautomatic rifles. ATF already receives this information for handguns. It is unfathomable that we would prevent law enforcement from having this information for semiautomatic rifles. especially when this amendment would make it more difficult to prevent the smuggling of guns to Mexican drug cartels. This backwards policy will put lives at risk. We must not let it stand in the final bill. Other measures must also be addressed before final enactment. The COPS program would be cut by $118 million. The ""wet side"" of NOAA is also cut. including a 40 percent reduction to fisheries habitat conservation and restoration. and the complete elimination of the communitybased restoration program. While the bill funds NOAA weather satellites and the National Weather Service. it includes a sizable cut of 24 percent to NOAA climate research. As the National Climate Assessment showed. storms and weather events are becoming more frequent. more severe and. as a result. more costly. We should be investing in research to combat the threat of climate change. not sticking our heads in the sand. pretending the science is wrong because combating such an obstacle would be too costly and inconvenient. While far from perfect in its current form. this is a reasonable bill that I can support. However. it is imperative that no poison pill policy riders be included during House consideration. As I close. I want to say to the chairmanChairman WOLFand Ranking Member FATTAH. this really is an example of bipartisan cooperation. You worked so effectively in putting this bill together. and I want to congratulate you. Before I close. I also want to thank the retiring chairman for your amazing service to our country. It really has been a pleasure for me to work with you. and we know there is never a doubt. when FRANK WOLF gets up to speak. he speaks with conviction and power and determination. You are so impressive. I do want to wish you and your family the very best. For me. it has really been a delight getting to know you. Thank you so much for your service."
2014,Madam Chair. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas
2014,Madam Chairman. when I was first assigned to the Appropriations Committee. I asked specifically to serve on the Commerce. Justice. Science Appropriations Committee because of my passion for the sciences. for NASA. for law enforcement. but especially to serve alongside
2014,Madam Chair. I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas . the ranking member on the Science Committee. the authorizing committee here in the House. and an extraordinary leader on science and innovation.
2014,Madam Chairman. funding for research innovation and STEM education is an investment in our future. perhaps the single most important investment we can make. Many of our competitors understand this and are striving to surpass the United States in innovation capacity and in the creation of a highlyskilled 21st century workforce. It used to be that the worlds best and brightest flocked to our shores. Now. many of our own best and brightest are finding better opportunities in other countries. or we are chasing them from STEM careers altogether. In 2007 and. again. in 2010. the U.S. Congress passed the America COMPETES Act. recognizing the importance of increased investment in research. innovation. and STEM education. signed into law by Presidents Bush and Obama. respectively. Appropriations have not kept pace with authorizations. but not from the lack of effort and commitment by appropriations colleagues. CJS Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman WOLF. Ranking Member FATTAH. Chairman ROGERS. and Ranking Member LOWEY. I want to thank them. my colleagues. for their enduring support for science. even when it meant making very difficult cuts elsewhere. As this is Chairman WOLFs last CJS bill. I want to express my personal gratitude to him in particular for being a strong and unwavering champion for the National Science Foundation and for STEM education. I will miss him greatly. We all will. In sad and puzzling contrast. last week. my own committee debated COMPETES reauthorization legislation that would turn back the progress we have made in securing our Nations future innovation capacity and voted out a bill this afternoon. a substitute today. without a single Democratic vote. Mr. Chairman. I urge my colleagues. in the strongest possible terms. to add their own vote of confidence in our Nations premier science agency. the National Science Foundation. It is the only agency to fund basic research across all fields of science and engineering. including. importantly. the social and behavioral sciences. The returns on our 65year investment in the National Science Foundation are too many and too significant to list here. But perhaps NSFs most important investment is the investment it makes in human capitalthe great scientists. innovators. and job creators of tomorrow and the workforce for tomorrows highskilled. highpaying jobs. Some of my colleagues efforts to cut funding. to impose political review over peerreview. to establish a message of distrust of scientists. and to inhibit the normal advance of science. are sending a chilling message to smart young people across the nation to not bother entering or sticking with STEM studies or careers. A vote to retain the modest 2.9 percent increase to NSF in todays legislation is a vote to hold onto our nations future innovators and job creators. I will make just a few brief remarks about other agencies within this appropriations bill. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is playing an increasingly critical role in cyber security. forensics. advanced manufacturing. and technology. and so many other topics critical to our nations security and wellbeing. I just wish we could do more for NIST in this bill. but I understand this was one of the difficult decisions that the appropriations committee confronted. I also want to thank Chairman WOLF and Ranking Member FATAH for their support for NASA. While I would like to see NASA funding at even higher levels. commensurate with the tasks that we are asking the agency to carry out. I am pleased that this bill proposes to fund NASA at an increase of about 1.4 percent over the Fiscal Year 2014 enacted appropriation. In particular. I support the bills sustained funding levels for exploration and the Orion spacecraft and Space Launch System. which are being prepared for critical flight tests in 2017 and 2021. and which will enable our nations return to human exploration of deep space. I also support the committees emphasis on the need to enhance research on the International Space Station. a unique and perishable asset that is important for both basic and applied research and for enabling our goals in human exploration of outer space. I am also pleased that the committee has sustained robust funding for NASAs science programs and. in particular. restored funding to NASAs planetary science program. which has experienced cuts in recent years. In addition. I applaud the committee for providing a robust increase for NASAs aeronautics program. which provides critical R&D to benefit our nations commercial aviation industry and helps sustain our nations competitiveness in global aviation. Finally. I must express one significant concern. and that is the large cut to climate research activities at NOAA. The level proposed in this bill is 44 percent below the Presidents request and 23 percent below current spending. A number of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to bury their heads in the sand as it relates to climate change. but cutting the research that will improve our understanding of and our ability to adapt to the impacts associated with climate change is not the answer. If anything. given the uncertainties that remain. we should be supporting increased funding not less. I hope the needed funding will be restored when this bill is conferenced with the Senate. In closing. I again want to thank Chairman WOLF. Ranking Member FATAH. and the rest of your Committee members for your efforts to protect and grow our nations science and innovation capacity.
2014,Madam Chair. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California .
2014,Madam Chair. I appreciate all the great things that the chairman has done. I echo the remarks. the praise that was sung by our friends from Texas to the great job that Chairman WOLF has done in his career. I appreciate. for example. tonight that he is yielding me this time. knowing that he has strong disagreement about which I will be speaking. Tomorrow. I will be offering an amendment to the CJS appropriations bill. along with my colleagues SAM
2014,Madam Chair. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the great State of California. Congressman
2014,I thank the gentleman for yielding. Madam Chair. I rise in general debate to talk about NOAA. But I first also want to echo everything that has been said about our great colleague from Virginia. FRANK WOLF. FRANK is one of the few Members of Congress who has visited my district. He actually went onto my property in Big Sur and ended up coming back and saying: Now I understand why you are so passionate about the oceans. It is an interesting committee that both Ranking Member FATTAH and Chairman WOLF head because it is a committee that has all of the Department of Commerce. it has all of the Department of Justice. and it has the science programs. NASA. NSF. and the Office of Science and Technology. Essentially. the science of America is in your hands. And this bill has a lot of it in there. Particularly. I would like to talk about NOAA. NOAA is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. And what has been happening is that. as we have gotten interested in the weather and as we have gotten interested in sort of the sky. we are putting a lot more money into it and sucking funds away from the oceans. And yet what is happening in the oceans is that they are dying. and if the ocean dies. planet Earth dies. So while there is money in this to look at the moons and oceans of other planets. we are going to do it at the peril of our own ocean. Our coastal economies support 81 percent of all U.S. employment in the United States. over 100 million jobs. Coastal economies contribute to 84 percent of the U.S. GDP. Ocean tourism is an $89.25 billion industry. It relies on healthy marine mammal populations. healthy coral reefs. and healthy clean waters and beaches. Just think of all of the people who recreate on beaches. If those were polluted. they wouldnt be able to do so. The United States plays a big role in the world. We are. in fact. hosting the international oceans conference next month. And one of the topics is going to be the blue economy: What does it mean to all the countries of the world and to the United States? So as we go through this bill. I just want to emphasize that the wet side needs as much attention as the sky side. Again. I thank the gentleman from Virginia. FRANK WOLF. for the great job that he has done.
2014,I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana .
2014,Madam Chair. I rise today first in recognition of the great professional public service offered by Chairman WOLF. I appreciate that so much. I also rise in support of H.R. 4660. the Commerce. Justice. Science. and Related Agencies Appropriations Act that he and his staff have worked so hard on. This important measure provides funding for a number of vital agencies. of course one of which is the Office of the United States Trade Representative. This approps bill provides funding for the USTR to continue advocating on behalf of the TransPacific Partnership. or TPP. and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. or TTIP. and to continue enforcing existing free trade agreements. More specifically. funding USTR will help protect intellectual property rights abroad. Now. I continue to maintain very serious concerns with Canadas misapplication of internationally recognized patent standards. which appears to violate their international obligations. and it is having a real economic impact on innovative American companies. I appreciate that the USTR has expressed serious concern about these practices in last years Special 301 Report. given Canadas continued failure to bring its patent standards in line with international obligations and best practices. Accordingly. I strongly urge the elevation of Canada to the Special 301 Priority Watch List in 2014. IP is one of the main engines of the United States innovative economy. Approximately onethird of U.S. jobs and 60 percent of our exports rely on IP. With more than 95 percent of the worlds population living outside of the United States. strong IP protections are essential to future U.S. economic growth and competitiveness. Funding USTR will ensure a continued enforcement of existing free trade agreements while furthering future U.S. economic interests through negotiation of TPP and TTIP. I would like to. again. thank Chairman WOLF and his staff for their important work in putting together this approps bill.
2014,Madam Chair. I yield myself as much time as I may consume. I want to take a minute to acknowledge someone else who has played a very important role in our countrys science activities and is now retiring. I spent some time over at NASA headquarters. and I also went out to visit the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to see the Mars Rover land after 81/2 months of travel. The NASA team is an extraordinary team. One of its members. the head of the Education Office. a former astronaut. is retiring. and I wanted to take a minute during general debate to acknowledge his great service to this country. Leland Melvin hails from the chairmans great State of the Commonwealth of Virginia. and we want to wish him well and thank him for his service to our country. I now yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois . my colleague who has worked here on small business and research connections to science to commercialize technology and to help build the American economy.
2014,I thank the ranking member for yielding. Madam Chair. I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4660. I would like to thank Chairman WOLF and Ranking Member FATTAH for their hard work on this bill. While they have had to make some tough budget choices with a reduced level of funding. this bill still shows a strong commitment to scientific research at the National Science Foundation and also NASA. Investment in research is vital to our economic future because it helps us achieve discoveries that will keep the U.S. at the cutting edge of science and technology and creating new American jobs. I also want to take a moment to honor my good friend from Virginia. Chairman WOLF. Even in an era of partisan polarization and heated rhetoric. he has taken great pains to craft bills like this one that get broad support from Members on both sides of the aisle. He has been a strong defender of American security and a strong supporter of American manufacturing. and. most importantly. throughout his career. he has been a courageous fighter for human rights around the world. while never losing sight of his duty to his constituents here at home. He has been a good example for all of us in this body. Madam Chair. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and to support the strong funding. especially for the National Science Foundation. in this bill.
2014,Madam Chair. I have no further requests for time. and I yield back the balance of my time.
2014,Madam Chair. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey. RUSH HOLT. my friend. the great science leader here in the Congress. He is the only one among us who has a terminal degree in nuclear science. and he is also retiring this year.
2014,I thank the gentleman. I certainly appreciate the very admirable Chairman WOLF and my good friend from Pennsylvania for the work they have put into crafting this bill. Madam Chair. however. I do have some serious concerns. especially as regards the cuts that are being made to NOAAs climate research programs. This bill cuts NOAAs climate research for the next fiscal year by $38 million below the current year. or $69 million below the Presidents request. Now. deeper droughts. heavier rains. more flooding. superstorms. tornadoes. rising seas. huge storm surges are all getting worse. Would we not want to understand what is going on? I will be offering an amendment later this evening to restore funding for critical NOAA climate research programs. NOAA climate research programs support ocean and atmospheric research. global data collection and sharing so we can understand climate change. This year. the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the U.S. National Climate Assessment were released. They agreed. They come to the same conclusion: the climate is changing. Greenhouse gases by human activities are the principal cause. We have already begun to experience the effects. which will continue to be costly in lives and dollars. Those who would deny these changes. some here in this very House. cant stop the changes from occurring. Denying funding for the research wont stop the changes. It will just leave us ignorant and less prepared. We need to support the science behind climate change. Now. since we are talking about science. it is true. ostriches dont actually bury their heads in the sand. but it is a metaphor for what is going on here. We should not bury our heads in the sand. We should be supporting this research vigorously because of all the ways that the climate change will affect our lives and our wellbeing both around the world and here in the United States.
2014,I have no further requests for time during general debate. and I yield back the balance of my time.
2014,Madam Chair. I have an amendment at the desk.
2014,Madam Chair. before I get started. I just want to join the chorus here and congratulate Chairman WOLF on his remarkable career as a leader here in this Congress and as someone who has worked diligently on behalf of his constituents but also in a way that I think has reflected greatly on this body. I think that the work product in this bill produced by Chairman WOLF and Ranking Member FATTAH is a wonderful example of the possibilities when people work together. Madam Chairman. my amendment would increase by $3 million the amount appropriated for fiscal year 2015 for the Drug Courts program. The $3 million added to the Drug Courts program will be offset by decreasing by $3 million the amount appropriated for funding the International Trade Administration. Madam Chair. drug addiction in the United States is at an epidemic level. To call it otherwise grossly understates the problem. This epidemic affects every city and town across America. and it cuts across every demographic. It simply does not discriminate. Drug and alcohol addiction shatters lives. destroys families. and costs taxpayers billions of dollars annually. In fact. according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. estimates of the total overall costs of substance abuse in the United Statesincluding lost productivity. inhospital care. incarceration. rehab. and crimerelated coststally to over $600 billion annually in the United States. Now. many of us understand that drug addiction is a disease. and certain actions taken by people under the influence of drugs are typically uncharacteristic of that person. A handful of countries. as well as much of our own society here in the United States. have begun to realize that we need to deal with addiction and its outcomes in a way that can have a longterm. positive effect on the parties and families involved. Drug courts offer just such an opportunity by providing a support system and a roadmap for moving forward. Madam Chair. drug courts are specialized court dockets designed to handle cases involving drug and/or alcoholdependent offenders charged with offenses such as possession of a controlled substance or other nonviolent offenses determined to have been caused or influenced by their addiction. Drug court cases are handled through a comprehensive program of supervision. drug testing. treatment services. and immediate sanctions and incentives designed to reduce the recidivism rates of these offenders by helping them overcome their substance abuse problems. which are the primary and proximate cause of their criminal activities. Drug courts coordinate the efforts of the judiciary. prosecution. defense attorneys. probation departments. law enforcement agencies. rehab facilities. mental health and social services. and also involve the community. the family. and the employer in many cases in an effort to break the cycle of substance abuse. addiction. and crime. If we can break that cycle. we all benefit. I have had the opportunity to visit many of the prisons and houses of correction in Massachusetts. where about 91 percent of those inmates have substance abuse problems or are dually addicted. The bottom line is that drug courts save money. they reduce crime. and restore families. Quite simply. drug courts work. According to the National Association of Drug Court Professionals. the drug court approach reduces crime by as much as 45 percent compared to traditional sentencing options. In fact. the available data indicate that nationwide. 75 percent of drug court graduates remain arrestfree at least 2 years after leaving the program. and reductions in crime have been maintained for at a minimum 3 years. and in many cases over 14 years. In addition to reducing crime. drug courts save money. As reported by the National Association of Drug Court Professionals. for every dollar invested in drug courts. taxpayers save as much as $27 when compared to the historic approach to these problems. This substantial savings comes from avoided criminal justice costs. reduced prison costs. and reduced recidivism and health care utilizationall areas. as we know. that devour vast sums of money annually in this country. And very important to us all. drug courts help restore families. According to statistics. family reunification rates for drug offenders are 50 percent higher for drug court participants. People struggling through addiction can become isolated from friends and loved ones. Reuniting with their family is often the first step in returning to normalcy and again becoming a productive member of the community. Madam Chairman. the underlying bill provides $41 million for drug court funding. $2.5 million over the 2013 postsequester level. And I would like to thank Chairman WOLFhe has long been a champion of drug courtsas has Ranking Member FATTAB. But these have been underfunded for a long time. and the adoption of this amendment would meet the need that has been amplified lately. I just urge my colleagues to support my amendment. and I yield back the balance of my time.
2014,Madam Chair. I move to strike the last word.
2014,I accept the amendment. The Presidents request had proposed eliminating this as a separate program. We rejected that proposal. and instead we funded the program above. as the gentleman from Massachusetts saidand I appreciate itabove the level of $41 million. This takes it to 44. He makes a very powerful case. I think it makes a lot of sense. so I accept the amendment. and I think it is a good amendment.
2014,Will the gentleman yield?
2014,I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.
2014,Madam Chair. I concur with the chairman.
2014,I yield back the balance of my time.
2014,Madam Chair. I have an amendment at the desk.
2014,Madam Chair. first. I certainly want to thank Chairman WOLF. Ranking Member FATTAH. and. of course. the committee for putting together a strong bill in what we all know has become an increasingly tough environment for appropriations bills. This years CommerceJusticeScience bill is clearly the product of a great deal of bipartisan collaboration. and. as a result. this bill provides strong funding for a number of important priorities that both Democrats and Republicans can get behind. In that vein. I want to offer an amendment which I believe both sides of the aisle should be able to support. While only a small portion of the overall Department of Commerce budget. the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service plays a critical role in helping American small business owners export their products to foreign countriesand we know that about 95 percent of the worlds customers live overseas. Unfortunately. while this years CJS bill does a decent job of funding the Department of Commerce. it failed to fully match the Presidents requested increase of funds for the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service. Unfortunately. that will mean that we will. once again. continue the trend of underfunding this vital national resource. Specificallyand I wanted to note these three pointsthis amendment helps small businesses who can benefit from overseas consumer activity by helping them learn how to navigate red tape imposed by governments overseas. Big companies we know dont necessarily need this help but our small business owners do. Second. it will help them increase exports. create jobs. and boost economic recovery. Third. the funding that was requested in this amendment is $3 million. The agency is currently $15 million below the Presidents request. So I want to share where the offset comes from. It comes from the Bureau of Prisons. which was overfunded by $61 millionand that is out of $7 billion. The offset does not touch funding for new construction. which we know there are concerns about overcrowding from time to time. That is not an issue in this amendment. Madam Chair. in order to remain competitive in an increasingly globalized economy. we must do everything that we can to help our exporters gain access to overseas markets. While this amendment only amounts to really a small increase in funding. we know from past experience that it will pay enormous dividends. I certainly have seen that in my community in California. Most importantly. it will allow U.S. exporters to compete on a level playing field with the rest of the world and will help strengthen the overall economy. putting Americans back to work. I urge my colleagues to support small business owners all across this country and adopt this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time.
2014,Madam Chair. I rise in opposition to the gentleladys amendment.
2014,"Madam Chair. the recommendation in this bill includes $323 million for the Global Markets program. which includes the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service. This amount is $3 million more than the current operating level. Despite the continued fiscal constraints. the committee has supported increases to the International Trade Administration over the last few fiscal years in order to support deployment of additional commercial service and staff at embassies. But this offset totally takes it from the Bureau of Prisons. It reduces the Bureau of Prisons salaries and expenses account by $3 million. The prisons are overcrowded. We have had several prison guards killed. With our high- and mediumsecurity institutions exceeding 51 and 41 percent of their rated capacity. the prisons are overpacked. They are maxed out. And so with a population of 215.000 inmates and 2.500 more expected in 2015. the Bureau of Prisons just cant keep up. So this bill helps them recover. We dont want to have another prison guard killed. So I think where they take the money fromI would urge a ""no"" vote on this amendment. and I yield back the balance of my time."
2014,Madam Chairman. I move to strike the last word.
2014,Madam Chairman. I rise in the first instance in support of the focus of the gentleladys amendment. but I have to oppose the amendment because of the offset. One of the prison guards that was murdered was from my home State of Pennsylvania. and I think that depleting $3 million from this account at a time when we have a situation where we have far too many people in prisonand hopefully through our criminal justice reform efforts. we will do something about thatbut while we have people in prison. we have a responsibility to administer these prisons safely. and I think it will be unwise. Now. I support wholeheartedly export initiatives. We have increased this account each year. I have visited and spent time focused on this. And the chairman had mentioned a number of initiatives. We also fund the SelectUSA and the other parts of the Presidents export initiative. But I am opposed to this amendment solely on the basis of the offset as offered. Madam Chair. I yield back the balance of my time.
2014,Madam Chair. I have an amendment at the desk.
2014,Madam Chair. I rise today to offer a critical amendment with Representatives PASCRELL. KING.
2014,Madam Chair. I move to strike the last word.
2014,I am going to accept the amendment. My father was a policemanPhiladelphia policeman. badge I think Mr. REICHERT makes a very. very powerful case. and I have great respect for law enforcement. I just want to put it in context. We are going to accept the amendment. but article I. section 2 of the Constitution requires a census every 10 years. This is one of the few areas where the Constitution actually requires this body to do something. Frankly. this body. a lot of times. does nothing. This. we are required to do it. This amendment cuts funding for the periodic census. Without getting into detail. we will try to work this out when we go to conference because I am sympathetic. We are going to start getting a lot more amendments: cut census. it is not for a few more years. But then the time comes. However. I think Mr. REICHERT makes a powerful case. We do respect law enforcement. and he makes a powerful case. We cannot solve the issue of sexual trafficking with just Federal officers. We need the sheriffs and the police departments. Having said all that. there will be some pain. and we will have to work this thing out. but I accept the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time.
2014,I move to strike the requisite number of words.
2014,Madam Chair. I support the chairman in accepting this amendment. but his warning about census and the need for us not to assume that we can walk out with a bill with zero for census and live up to our responsibilitiesour constitutional responsibilityis not an appropriate notion for this Congress. so I do support this one. I am going to be opposing many others. I yield back the balance of my time.
2014,Madam Chair. I move to strike the last word.
2014,Madam Chair. I just want to say to FRANK WOLF: you are good man. and I wish you the best of luck. You raised the respect of this institution. and that is pretty difficult to do nowadays. FRANK. I wish you the best of luck. As cosponsor of this amendment. along with some others. I want to thank all of those folks who came aboard. We have to struggle every 2 or 3 years. I think it is the responsibility that we. in some way. support our local communities. our county sheriff departments.
2014,Madam Chair. I move to strike the last word.
2014,Madam Chair. first. let me start by thanking my colleagues.
2014,Madam Chair. I have an amendment at the desk.
2014,Madam Chair. my amendment would ensure that the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center under the International Trade Administrations budget is funded at this Presidents requested level of $15 million by moving $10 million from NASAs $4.2 billion exploration fund. which is funded $191 million above the Presidents request. Here is the problem: Mr. PETERS and I. who offer this amendment. represent the State of Michigan. but I assume this problem. the problem of access to markets across the globe for American products. is one that other Members in this body experience on a regular basis and hear about all the time. We may disagree. and I suspect that we would disagree on the elements of our trade policy and particularly the elements in form that many of the trade agreements that this country enters into with other Nations. In fact. there is a debate brewing now over the extent to which we continue to expand those international trade agreements. but the one thing we ought not to disagree on is whether or not we enforce the existing structures that are in place and ensure that Americanmade products have access to markets that should be open to us and. under existing agreements. would be open to us if we had the strength and the resources to enforce those agreements the way they ought to be enforced. and this is having a real effect. I represent Michigan. as I said. and the auto sector particularly has suffered greatly as a result of trade practices. Just recently. as a matter of fact. the WTO sided with the U.S. in a dispute with China on duties it imposes on imported American vehicles. duties ranging from 2 percent to 21.5 percent. affecting twothirds of the $8.5 billion worth of American vehicles that are sold into that market. This amendment would ensure that there are adequate resources to ensure that we enforce existing trade policy. American workers and companies are harmed when other countries are allowed to use unfair trade policies unfettered. This amendment would ensure that the Interagency Trade Enforcement Center has the necessary resources to go after unfair trade barriers. It sends a strong message to the world that: If you violate global trade laws. the rules will be enforced and that there will be consequences for bad behavior. American workers deserve this. American companies deserve this. We should stand strong. This amendment would make sure that the resources are available to do just that. I yield back the balance of my time.
2014,Madam Chair. I move to strike the last word.
2014,"I rise in opposition to the amendment. The amendment would take away from NASAs Commercial Crew Program. This is a program where we are paying the RussiansPutin. who invaded the CrimeaPutin. we are paying Putinthis takes it away from that. allowing NASA to fund fewer development and testing activities. It would increase the likeliness that we will have to extend our reliance on Russia for access to the space station. The Russians have even said that we are going to have to use a trampoline to get to the space station. They are going to stop cooperating after 2020. I could say more. but I dont think we want to take money from that program. Because of that. I urge a ""no"" vote. I yield back the balance of my time."
2014,Madam Chair. I move to strike the requisite number of words.
2014,I support the intent of the amendment. I cant support the offset. It comes out of the general exploration account of NASA. but it would put additional strains on programs like Commercial Crew and Commercial Cargo. which are very. very importantnot just because we have to depend on the Russians at the moment to take astronauts to the space station. this was put in place years agobut given the political circumstances. and the chairman is right. there have been threats to whether or not we will have access to transport. We do have to think about accelerating our Commercial Crew Program. It has been very successful to date. in terms of cargo. but we have not utilized the commercial cargo system yet to actually put human beings into lower Earth orbit on private spaceships like SpaceX or Orbital Science. so it is a concern now that this offset would be used. So I think what I am saying is that I hope the gentleman will consider the fact that we will look at this issue in conference and try to find other ways to do it. but I cannot support this offset. It would not be a responsible thing for us to do. given where we are. I yield back the balance of my time.
2014,Madam Chair. I have an amendment at the desk.
2014,Madam Chair. the amendment that I offer today addresses a topic that is of the utmost importance to our national defense. that is. cybersecurity. Before I go into the particulars. I would like to first acknowledge the important work of my colleague. Chairman WOLF. on this vital issue. Although he is retiring at the end of the year. he has certainly left a legacy of support for cybersecurity funding which he and Ranking Member FATTAH have continued in this bill. I thank them both for their important work. Madam Chair. bad actors in cyberspace are growing in number and in sophistication. and as policymakers we have an imperative to act in the public interest. When Congress came up short in its efforts to enact comprehensive cybersecurity legislation in the 112th Congress. the administration rightly acted as best it could to advance the ball on cybersecurity. The President issued an executive order on this topic. and among the many things it did. it charged the National Institute for Standards and Technology with the creation of a framework for cybersecurity. and it ensured an open process. engaging all parties from across the spectrum of industry. government. and academia. Madam Chair. my simple amendment endorses the use of routine Department of Commerce surveys in order to measure the extent to which businesses have adopted the NIST voluntary cybersecurity framework. In fact. my amendment will ensure that the Bureau of Industry and Securitys Office of Technology Evaluation uses its Defense Production Act authority to conduct a survey about use of the NIST framework. While I applaud the Presidents focus on cybersecurity. and the NIST process has been widely regarded as a laudable example of publicprivate partnership. much more needs to be done. and the administration cannot go it alone. It will take congressional action to address issues such as incentives. liability protections. information sharing. and breach notification. However. while we continue to work toward passage of bipartisan cybersecurity legislation. it is important that we measure how well the NIST framework is faring. Our routine Commerce Department survey. using existing authority under the Defense Production Act. will enable an assessment of the NIST frameworks adoption rate. a key component of its effectiveness. Information sharing is also an important part of the framework. so the survey will also allow BIS to ask companies what. if any. information from the government they have used and how they have used it. This brief survey should be designed in a way to minimize the burden on companies: determining if their using the framework or information shared from the government does not require an exhaustive survey of their cybersecurity practices.
2014,Madam Chair. I move to strike the requisite number of words.
2014,Madam Chair. the gentleman is absolutely right. I completely agree with him. We will make every effort to make sure this is in there. He has been ahead of almost everybody else here. but I accept the amendment. I think it is a very good amendment. and I yield back the balance of my time.
2014,Madam Chair. I rise in support of the amendment also.
2014,Madam Chair. I thank the chairman for agreeing to accept it. I want to spend a second on this. There is no more important an issue facing our country in terms of national security than this question of cybersecurity. and Chairman WOLF has been at the very forefront of this. We have seen the unfortunate circumstance. for instance. with a corporation like Target. Target has invested over a billion dollars in revitalizing libraries in our schools in our country. They have done a lot of great work. They were victimized by cyber criminals emanating from. apparently. Ukraine. I think that whatever assistance we are providing to the new government there should be contingent on making sure that the cyber threat emanating from Ukraine visited upon our companies here should be part of the considerations. The chairman has also pointed out what has now become obvious. given the DOJs action. that China is also quite active in this realm. We have seen this problem in places like Nigeria. We can go around the globe. If we are going to protect ourselves. we are going to have to take action. I thank the chairman for accepting this amendment. I think this is an appropriate improvement to the base bill. and I yield back the remainder of my time.
2014,Madam Chair. parliamentary inquiry.
2014,Would a motion be in order to suspend the rules and bring up an amendment that was in the previous section at this time?
2014,Thank you. Madam Chair.
2014,Madam Chair. I have an amendment at the desk.
2014,Madam Chair. I reserve a point of order on the gentleman s amendment.
2014,Madam Chair. I thank and acknowledge the work of Chairman WOLF and our Ranking Member FATTAH for their exhaustive work on this appropriations bill. Madam Chair. in an effort to drive innovation and regional collaboration. the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 established a Regional Innovation Program within the Economic Development Administration. This program is intended to encourage and support the development of regional innovation strategies. including regional innovation clusters and science and research parks. For the past few years. the President has consistently requested $25 million to fund the Regional Innovation Strategies Program. The program was provided $10 million in funding in the fiscal year 2014 omnibus appropriations bill passed by this Chamber a few months ago. Funding for the Regional Innovation Program supports the Economic Development Agencys interagency effort to build regional innovation clusters. including the Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Challenge and the Make It In America challenge. This program helps to ensure we build a cohesive. competitive economy by aggregating existing investments and technical assistance from multiple Federal agencies to develop a network of interconnected firms and institutions. Together. this network and other regional stakeholders can use this funding to accelerate job growth. spur business formation and expansion. encourage innovation. invest in workforce training. and support small business development. For example. the i6 Challenge grants funded within the Regional Innovation Program have already helped universities and research centers across the country invest in efforts to scale up groundbreaking ideas. This means providing these innovators with the necessary resources to accelerate commercialization and to attract venture capital for the most promising technologies. To compete in the 21st century and win. America must invest in scaling up promising technology and innovative ideas. In the longterm. these ideas will help ensure our Nation remains at the cutting edge. Importantly. investing now will help jumpstart our competitive advantage in terms of producing emerging technologies and supporting advanced manufacturing. Through the Regional Innovation Program. local leaders are empowered to maximize existing assets and are provided resources to ensure that historically underrepresented communities. including those hardest hit by unemployment and economic decline. are able to participate in and benefit from a growth in a regional cluster. The Regional Innovation Program has traditionally garnered support from both Republicans and Democrats. It is a truly bipartisan. evidencebased method for creating jobs. My amendment is simple and straightforward. It would not create a new program or new authorization. It does not increase or decrease funding for a single account in the appropriations bill. Instead. this amendment simply serves to include the Regional Innovation Program within the bill and to bring focus to this vitally important jobcreating initiative as this appropriations process moves forward. In addition. the Regional Innovation Program has consistently been specifically supported and cited with a separate line item in previous Senate CJS Appropriations Committee reports. To close. I strongly believe we must recognize that innovation is critically important to Americas ability to compete in the 21st century global economy. Supporting the development of regional innovation clusters strengthens our capacity to create and retain new jobs and sustain our economic recovery. The Regional Innovation Program will help Federal. State. and local entities leverage existing resources. spur regional collaboration. and support economic recovery and job creation in highgrowth industries. I recognize. after conferring with Chairman WOLF. that there is a point of order that has been raised on this. Madam Chair. I ask unanimous consent to withdraw this amendment and look forward to working with the chairman and the committee to see that this program is both reauthorized and funded.
2014,Madam Chair. I have an amendment at the desk.
2014,"Madam Chairwoman. today. I rise to ask my fellow Members of Congress to take one small step towards fiscal sanity. Chairman WOLF has done very nice work on this bill. but we are all familiar with agencies that have outlived their usefulness and no longer can withstand budget scrutiny. In these times. if we dont set priorities. nothing is a priority. Here is one opportunity for all of us to make one tiny step towards getting rid of what is now over $17 trillion in debt. We often talk on our side of the aisle about having a spending problem. Here is a chance for all of us on both sides of the aisle to begin to attack that. We have an opportunity. Part of the Department of Commerce. the Economic Development Administration. was established in 1965 as an element of President Lyndon Johnsons Great Society. The current administration and. to be frank. many administrations. have used this for their own pork barrel projects and their own cookie jar. The EDA has spent over $3.2 billion in grants and does nothing more than pick amongst winners and losers by region. industry. and community. At its very core. the EDA is nothing more than the purest of wealth distribution programs. My amendment would eliminate funding for the EDA. totaling $247 million in fiscal year 2015. and send this money to the deficit reduction account. Based on current levels. eliminating EDA will save over $2.5 billion over the next decade. Even though I ran two small businesses for 16 years. I had never heard of the Economic Development Administration before coming to Congress. I suspect many of my colleagues are similarly situated. First. let me describe what the EDA does. It takes dollars from all across the country. That money comes to Washington where the EDA takes 20 percent of it off the top. That is the cost of the administrative burden of running the Economic Development Administration. They then ask companies and communities to apply for ""free money"" from the Federal Government to renovate a movie theater or to build a new industrial park. While many much these projects arent necessarily bad. some are just plain ridiculous. These are local projects that either have enough support from their local communities so they could certainly advance without Federal funding or they require Federal money because the local community wont support them. Either way. the Federal Government has no role in being involved. You might not be familiar with EDA projects. so let me just talk about a couple of them. In 2008. the Economic Development Administration provided $2 million to begin construction of the UNLV Harry Reid Research and Technology Park in Las Vegas. Nevada. Currently. this technology park features a paved road and a Web site claiming to be the first anticipated tenant moving in in 2010. No construction has even begun. In 2010. $25 million was spent by the EDA for a Global Climate Mitigation Incentive Fund and $2 million for a ""culinary amphitheater."" winetasting room. and gift shop in Washington State. The EDA then gave New Mexico $1.5 million to renovate a theater in 2012. In 2013 it gave Massachusetts $1.4 million to promote video games. Back in the 1980s. the EDA used taxpayer dollars to build replicas of the Great Wall of China and the Egyptian pyramids in the middle of Indiana. They were never completed. It is now a dumping ground for tires. After doling out your tax dollars. the Economic Development Administration often. along with a local Congressman or Senator. takes credit for these projects. They go to ribbon cuttings. The EDA is a frequent flyer. traveling all around the country. for just such ceremonies. I first heard about the EDA in one such project. I was sitting in a committee where the director of the EDA proudly took credit for the jobs created at a $1.6 billion new steel plant. There was a $1.4 million grant. less than onetenth of 1 percent of the project. My guess is that the companys CFO knew nothing of the EDA grant. Cutting the EDA. however. is not just a conservative idea. it is a good idea. and one that gets us closer to fiscal sanity here in America. Madam Chairwoman. my amendment is fairly modest given the amount of debt we are piling onto our children and grandchildren. But this is an important vote to show that Members of this body are serious about limiting the size and scope of our Federal Government. I urge passage of this amendment. and I yield back the balance of my time."
2014,Madam Chair. I move to strike the requisite number of words. The Acting CHAIR (Ms. Foxx). The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes.
2014,Madam Chair. I rise in opposition to the gentlemans amendment. This bill before the House today also includes for the EDA $5 million to support projects to facilitate relocation to the United States of jobs currently being done overseas. If you have an iPhone. it is made in China. GE has moved plants off of the United States to China. This is in order to fund. It will enable EDA to help work with American businesses to bring back. to repatriate. their manufacturing activities back to the United States. It does not support any projects in my district. but it does support projects in some very. very poor districts throughout the United States. These are areas that are struggling. Because of that. sometimes EDA is only a lifeline. a path. to more economic sustainability. I oppose the amendment. and I yield back the balance of my time.
2014,Madam Chairman. I move to strike the last word. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes.
2014,Madam Chairman. first of all. in terms of the previous amendment that was withdrawn. it is very important that we note that innovation is the driving force in our economy. The World Economic Forum said: Americas economy is built on innovation. So I want to just add my voice in terms of that amendment. but in terms of the offering relative to the Economic Development Administration. The Speaker of the House earlier was saying that as you listen to Americans. they are concerned about jobs. Well. one entity in the Federal government has a track record of developing jobs in each of our 50 States. Just recently they announced a 300.000mile initiative in Alaska. Now. Alaska is a little bit away from my hometown in Philadelphia. Pennsylvania. but wherever you look in our country. the EDA has been working. It stitches together communities of interest. builds support in jobs. It is a program that the majority would love because it is not decisions from on high. These are decisions that are made at the local level about where to build industry. what types of industries to attract. It has a proven record decade after decade stitched throughout America. not one piece of unbroken cloth. but kind of like a quilt. many colors. many different pieces patched together. So I support the EDA. I oppose this amendment. and I hope that we give a resounding vote in support of the Economic Development Administration. If we can spend American taxpayers money in far off places in this world building economies under the notion that that is how you strengthen democracies and provide peaceful places in the world. then we can take American taxpayers money and invest it in communities right here at home so that Americans can go to work. I yield back the balance of my time.
2014,Madam Chairman. I move to strike the last word. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.
2014,"My congressional district. Madam Chairman. encompasses rural parts of southern and eastern Kentucky. The region has historically lagged behind others in the Commonwealth and in the country. Particularly in recent years. as we have reeled from a crushing downturn in the coal industry that has cost my district some 8.000 goodpaying mining jobs in just the last few months. we have had to think and act strategically to revitalize our economic engine. Creating jobs in a mountainous region without sufficient roadways or suitable water infrastructure might seem an unsurmountable challenge. But I have always encouraged my constituents and community leaders to ""plan their work. and work their plan."" With the help of EDA. this is what we have been doing. The Economic Development Administration is one of the few entities in our Federal Government uniquely qualified to address the needs of communities with chronically high unemployment issues or facing enormous setbacks due to natural disasters. EDAs grants. awarded in a competitive fashion. leverage over $10 from the private sector for every Federal dollar invested and are targeted at facilities that are essential for private industry to remain or locate in these underachieving areas. As a result of these targeted investments in water systems. workforce training centers. intermodal facilities. or broadband networks. struggling communities across the country have seen the creation of hundreds of thousands of jobs in just the last decade. I wholeheartedly concur with the sponsor of the amendment that the role of the Federal Government is not to create jobs. but instead to create the conditions favorable for private sector job creation. By partnering with local area development districts. leveraging public and private dollars. and engaging the local workforce. EDA does just that. This bill provides $247.5 million for the agency. which is already below the Presidents request. rejects the administrations request to shift funds away from vital public works programs. and supports a loan guarantee program to develop innovative manufacturing technologies that will keep rural areas competitive nationally and globally. With unemployment in rural areas around the country still hovering well above the national average. particularly in coal country. the victims of the war on coal. this is an investment we cannot afford to lose. I urge a ""no"" vote on the amendment. and I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Kansas ."
2014,Madam Chairman. I demand a recorded vote. The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII. further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Kansas will be postponed.
2014,Madam Chairman. I move to strike the last word. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes.
2014,"Madam Chairman. let me begin by expressing my admiration for my colleague from Virginia. the chairman of the Commerce. Justice. Science Subcommittee. FRANK WOLF. The Commonwealth of Virginia. the Nation. and. indeed. individuals from around the world owe Chairman WOLF a deep debt of gratitude for his years of service. The positive impacts of FRANK WOLFs efforts literally span the globe as he has been a leader in the fight for. and defense of. human rights and religious freedom around the world. Chairman WOLF is a principled leader. and I and the rest of my colleagues will miss his leadership in this House in the years to come. Madam Chairman. I also rise to address the issue of funding for research through the National Science Foundation. I believe the Federal Government has an important role to play in basic research. including the research conducted by the National Science Foundation. The dollars we invest in research in the physical and biological sciences. in particular. have the potential to cure diseases and create new innovations that will become the building blocks for future economic growth and prosperity. But I have been troubled that the administration has been spending scarce Federal resources allocated to the National Science Foundation. not on these hard sciences. but instead on political and social science research. including. for example. the attitude of Americans on the filibuster. studying ""what makes politics interesting."" and how politicians change their Web sites. The National Science Foundation even spent $700.000 to fund a musicala musical. not researchon climate change. My colleague. LAMAR SMITH. the chairman of the Science. Space. and Technology Committee. has been leading an effort to reform the NSF to eliminate wasteful spending and prioritize research that has the potential of truly benefiting our Nation. Chairman SMITHS committee currently has a National Science Foundation reform bill under consideration. That bill takes important steps to set appropriate national priorities. I thank him for his efforts on this important front. In addition. Chairman SMITH is offering an amendment that will be offered tomorrow to this bill that would seek to leave funding for the social. behavioral. and economic sciences directorate at the current year levels and then allocate the $15 million increase requested by the President to other research priorities. I fully support Chairman SMITHS amendment and urge my colleagues to support it as well. This is the first step of many that I hope we will take to protect taxpayers while at the same time ensuring that high priority research is appropriately funded. I look forward to continuing to work with Chairman SMITH on this initiative. With that. I yield back the balance of my time."
2014,Madam Chair. I move to strike the requisite number of words. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes.
2014,Madam Chair. first of all. I appreciate the majority leader. I know for certain that he has an interest. particularly in these areas that he has spoken about. because on one day. at the end of a long week. the two of us ventured over to the National Institutes of Health to sit and learn a little bit more about the meritbased selection process for investment and investigations to end diseases. and LAMAR SMITH. who is a great Member. led the effort on patent reform. However. I think that both are misguided in this attempt to move away from the worldrenowned meritbased selection process at the National Science Foundation. All of our competitors are actually trying to mimic the meritbased selection process that the National Science Foundation utilizes. and it is critically important that the National Science Board. in the ways that these decisions are made. is not going to be influenced by politics. That was in the wisdom of the creation of this. and it has worked so well that we now lead the world. If we want to continue to lead the world. the last thing we want to do is to interject politics into the decisionmaking process of what basic scientific research should be supported. There are more proposals that come in than can be funded that are done on a peerreview. scienceonly basis. and I think it would be a very unwise signal for this Congress to send if we were to move in this direction. I hope that our colleagues. even though we have great respect for the majority leader. would act with more respect for basic science and for a meritbased selection process. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.
2014,Madam Chair. I have an amendment at the desk. The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.
2014,First of all. let me begin by recognizing my friend. Chairman WOLF. for his long and distinguished career in public servicea role model for all of us. Let me say also how impressed all of us are with the teamwork of Chairman WOLFs and of Ranking Member FATTAHs in putting together this piece of legislation. I am giving it my highest endorsement here. Madam Chair. I rise today to offer an amendment about an issue that is of grave concern to us in upstate New York. which is of the heroin and opiate epidemic that is going on. From the stories I have read. this is actually an issue across our country. I will note that the Governor of Vermont spent the time in his State of the State to address this issue. We certainly have to do more on this score. I have convened meetings in which I have had an opportunity to listen very carefully to district attorneys. to law enforcement professionals. to medical professionals. and to the families of those affected. Without any doubt. we are going to have to do more to address this issue. I see it in three basic categories. One is doing more on prevention. The second is enforcement. The third is treatment. Treatment is handled in the LaborHHS bill. and I look forward to our addressing that in the weeks to come. Tonight. we can address prevention and enforcement. I do want to commend the committee. and I do want to read of some specific areas of the bill in which the committee. I think. has done great on this issue. In DEA Language: Prescription drug and heroin abuse the committee is extremely concerned about the continued threat posed by prescription drug abuse. as well as about the resurgence of heroin abuse and overdoses that appear connected to the enforcement of laws against prescription drug diversion. The committee has included in its recommendation funding to support the enhancement of DEAs investigative efforts to deal with these growing threats and directs DEA to report to the committee no later than 60 days after the enactment of this Act on the numbers of actual and estimated heroin investigations in fiscal years 2013 through 2015. the amounts and street value of heroin associated with such investigations and prosecutions resulting from investigations. In the DOJ General Administration: Heroin the committee notes with concern the increase in heroin abuse. The Department shall report no later than 90 days after the enactment of this act on potential ways to address this problem. such as prevention. law enforcement strategies. prescription drug disposal site expansion. and other evidencebased approaches. Then. finally. in Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force: Herointhe recent surge in heroin use. overdose deaths. and trafficking volumes shows it to be one of the gravest problems now facing law enforcement and the drug treatment community. DEA noted in its 2013 threat assessment a trend of users switching to heroin from prescription drug abuse as one explanation for a rise in overdose deaths and warned that persons addicted to opioid prescription pills now find highly pure heroin easier and cheaper to obtain. The committee urges the Department to intensify its use of task forces to address this disturbing trend. I commend the committee for their work on this. I rise to offer an amendment to increase. by $4 million. the funding for the account that addresses the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force. This will help our countryand my district in particularin dealing with highlevel traffickers and gangs that are selling heroin and opioids. I think this will help. It will be part of an overarching strategy. and I think it synchronizes with the committee. so I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time.
2014,Madam Chair. I move to strike the requisite number of words. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes.
2014,Madam Chair. I have no objection to the amendment. I think it is a very good amendment. and I share the gentlemans concern. Out in the western part of my district. in the Shenandoah Valley. I think they had one heroin death in 2011 or in 2012. In 2013 and this year. they are surpassing that. and it is only May. This is going to be an epidemic. It is hitting the country. They are actually finding that growers of marijuana in Mexico are getting out of that business and are growing poppies. So I think it is a very good amendment. and I urge the support of it. I yield back the balance of my time.
2014,Madam Chair. I move to strike the last word. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes.
2014,Madam Chair. I also rise in support of the amendment. This is a crisis any way you look at it in my home State of Pennsylvania whether it is in the Pocono Mountains area or in the city of Philadelphia. All throughout the country. we see this epidemic. People are losing their lives. and extraordinary action needs to be taken. I do want to say that our side. even though we support this particular amendment. is concerned about the offset. Just so that we can start to make sure that everyone understands that we are concerned about it. we will want a recorded vote on this. and I will vote in favor of it as we do have a responsibility at some point to think about funding the census. So I will stop there. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York .
2014,Madam Chair. I have an amendment at the desk.
2014,Madam Chair. I ask for a recorded vote on the last one. The Acting CHAIR. The Committee had already progressed to the next amendment.
2014,I indicated in my remarks that we were asking for a recorded vote. Would you like to read back my remarks? The Acting CHAIR. The Chair did not see any Member seeking recognition for that purpose at the time the result of the voice vote was called.
2014,Madam Chair. I respect your decision then. and we will proceed. Thank you.
2014,First. I want to recognize Chairman WOLF for his service to this body and to this country. and I want to recognize the chairman and Ranking Member FATTAH for their work on this bill. Madam Chair. my amendment takes $3 million from the Census Bureau and transfers it to the COPS grant program. with the intent that this $3 million will go toward the COPS Technology grants program at the Department of Justice. I am proud to represent Californias Ninth Congressional District and the work our law enforcement agencies are doing in our region. However. they need additional support. Several cities in my district have violent crime rates that are well above State averages. Law enforcement agencies are understaffed and are struggling to retain and recruit officers. These first responders are doing their best to stretch budgets in tough economic times while trying to manage crime activity. This is an extremely difficult task that stresses police departments. officers. their families. and our neighborhoods. Consequently. it is even more important that our communities and law enforcement work together to ensure crime fighting is as effective as possible while also yielding the best results. One way to accomplish this goal is through improvements in technology. This increases effectiveness. It streamlines capabilities and increases information sharing. Most importantly. it improves the publics and officers safety. Through 2010. the COPS Technology program helped more than 3.000 law enforcement agencies acquire essential technology to help meet the needs of their regions. That demand for technology funding by law enforcement agencies across the country has increased in the past 4 years. I recently met with the chief of police from a city in my district who asked how his department could obtain funding for an innovative project that will help officers identify the exact location of gun shops within the city. This pilot project in a very small area has been extremely successful. These technology grants would be awarded on a competitive basis. ensuring that each applicant has a fair opportunity to receive money and to acquire and deploy crime fighting technologies. I do understand the concerns about taking money from the Census Bureau as it begins its preparations for the 2020 census. but I believe that individuals. families. and businesses in high crime areas would greatly benefit from the COPS Technology grant funding in the short and in the long term. This technology will save lives. Lastly. I want to mention that the International Association of Chiefs of Police supports my amendment. and I urge the adoption of the amendment. I yield back the balance of my time.
2014,Madam Chair. I move to strike the requisite number of words. The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes.
2014,Madam Chair. I announce that we are going to postpone the 2020 census and move it to 2021 or maybe to I am going to accept the amendment. but if we keep taking it from the census. there will be no census unless it is going to be done on a voluntary basis. and we can ask people if they will. I think it is a good amendment. I understand what you are trying to do. but if we keep fining census. census. census. then there will be no census. I accept the gentlemans amendment. He makes a very powerful case. and I think it is a very good issue. I yield back the balance of my time. The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California .

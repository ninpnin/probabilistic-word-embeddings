 anarchism is a political philosophy and movement that is sceptical of authority and rejects all involuntary coercive forms of hierarchy anarchism calls for the abolition of the state which it holds to be unnecessary undesirable and harmful as a historically left wing movement placed on the farthest left of the political spectrum it is usually described alongside libertarian marxism as the libertarian wing libertarian socialism of the socialist movement and has a strong historical association with anti capitalism and socialism humans lived in societies without formal hierarchies long before the establishment of formal states realms or empires with the rise of organised hierarchical bodies scepticism toward authority also rose although traces of anarchist thought are found throughout history modern anarchism emerged from the enlightenment during the latter half of the one nine th and the first decades of the two zero th century the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers struggles for emancipation various anarchist schools of thought formed during this period anarchists have taken part in several revolutions most notably in the paris commune the russian civil war and the spanish civil war whose end marked the end of the classical era of anarchism in the last decades of the two zero th and into the two one st century the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more anarchism employs a diversity of tactics in order to meet its ideal ends which can be broadly separated into revolutionary and evolutionary tactics there is significant overlap between the two which are merely descriptive revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state having taken a violent turn in the past while evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like anarchist thought criticism and praxis have played a part in diverse areas of human society criticism of anarchism include claims that it is internally inconsistent violent or utopian etymology terminology and definition wilhelm weitling is an example of a writer who added to anarchist theory without using the exact term the etymological origin of anarchism is from the ancient greek anarkhia meaning without a ruler composed of the prefix an without and the word arkhos leader or ruler the suffix ism denotes the ideological current that favours anarchy anarchism appears in english from one six four two as anarchisme and anarchy from one five three nine early english usages emphasised a sense of disorder various factions within the french revolution labelled their opponents as anarchists although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists many revolutionaries of the one nine th century such as william godwin one seven five six one eight three six and wilhelm weitling one eight zero eight one eight seven one would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation but did not use anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was pierre joseph proudhon one eight zero nine one eight six five marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid one nine th century since the one eight nine zero s and beginning in france libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and its use as a synonym is still common outside the united states some usages of libertarianism refer to individualistic free market philosophy only and free market anarchism in particular is termed libertarian anarchism while the term libertarian has been largely synonymous with anarchism its meaning has more recently diluted with wider adoption from ideologically disparate groups including both the new left and libertarian marxists who do not associate themselves with authoritarian socialists or a vanguard party and extreme cultural liberals who are primarily concerned with civil liberties additionally some anarchists use libertarian socialist to avoid anarchism s negative connotations and emphasise its connections with socialism anarchism is broadly used to describe the anti authoritarian wing of the socialist movement anarchist historian daniel gu rin described it as a synonym for libertarian socialism and wrote that anarchism is really a synonym for socialism the anarchist is primarily a socialist whose aim is to abolish the exploitation of man by man anarchism is only one of the streams of socialist thought that stream whose main components are concern for liberty and haste to abolish the state in his many works on anarchism such as chomsky on anarchism two zero zero five historian noam chomsky describes anarchism alongside libertarian marxism as the libertarian wing of socialism group nb anarchism is contrasted to socialist forms which are state oriented or from above scholars of anarchism generally highlight anarchism s socialist credentials and criticise attempts at creating dichotomies between the two some scholars describe anarchism as having many influences from liberalism and being both liberals and socialists but more so while most scholars reject anarcho capitalism as a misunderstanding of anarchist principles peter marshall states that in general anarchism is closer to socialism than liberalism anarchism finds itself largely in the socialist camp but it also has outriders in liberalism it cannot be reduced to socialism and is best seen as a separate and distinctive doctrine according to jeremy jennings it is hard not to conclude that these ideas referring to anarcho capitalism are described as anarchist only on the basis of a misunderstanding of what anarchism is jennings adds that anarchism does not stand for the untrammelled freedom of the individual as the anarcho capitalists appear to believe but as we have already seen for the extension of individuality and community nicolas walter wrote that anarchism does derive from liberalism and socialism both historically and ideologically in a sense anarchists always remain liberals and socialists and whenever they reject what is good in either they betray anarchism itself we are liberals but more so and socialists but more so michael newman includes anarchism as one of many socialist traditions especially the more socialist aligned tradition following proudhon and mikhail bakunin brian morris argues that it is conceptually and historically misleading to create a dichotomy between socialism and anarchism group nb while opposition to the state is central to anarchist thought defining anarchism is not an easy task for scholars as there is a lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently and etymology negation of rulers group nb major definitional elements include the will for a non coercive society the rejection of the state apparatus the belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non coercive society and a suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy history pre modern era upright seven zeno of citium c three three four c two six two bc whose republic inspired peter kropotkin before the establishment of towns and cities an established authority did not exist it was after the creation of institutions of authority that anarchistic ideas espoused as a reaction the most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in china and greece in china philosophical anarchism the discussion on the legitimacy of the state was delineated by taoist philosophers zhuang zhou and laozi alongside stoicism taoism has been said to have had significant anticipations of anarchism anarchic attitudes were also articulated by tragedians and philosophers in greece aeschylus and sophocles used the myth of antigone to illustrate the conflict between rules set by the state and personal autonomy socrates questioned athenian authorities constantly and insisted on the right of individual freedom of conscience cynics dismissed human law nomos and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature physis stoics were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state in medieval europe there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements these and other muslim movements later gave birth to religious anarchism in the sasanian empire mazdak called for an egalitarian society and the abolition of monarchy only to be soon executed by emperor kavad i in basra religious sects preached against the state in europe various sects developed anti state and libertarian tendencies renewed interest in antiquity during the renaissance and in private judgment during the reformation restored elements of anti authoritarian secularism particularly in france enlightenment challenges to intellectual authority secular and religious and the revolutions of the one seven nine zero s and one eight four eight all spurred the ideological development of what became the era of classical anarchism modern era during the french revolution partisan groups such as the enrag s and the saw a turning point in the fermentation of anti state and federalist sentiments the first anarchist currents developed throughout the one eight th century as william godwin espoused philosophical anarchism in england morally delegitimising the state max stirner s thinking paved the way to individualism and pierre joseph proudhon s theory of mutualism found fertile soil in france by the late one eight seven zero s various anarchist schools of thought had become well defined and a wave of then unprecedented globalisation occurred from one eight eight zero to one nine one four this era of classical anarchism lasted until the end of the spanish civil war and is considered the golden age of anarchism upright mikhail bakunin opposed the marxist aim of dictatorship of the proletariat and allied himself with the federalists in the first international before his expulsion by the marxists drawing from mutualism mikhail bakunin founded collectivist anarchism and entered the international workingmen s association a class worker union later known as the first international that formed in one eight six four to unite diverse revolutionary currents the international became a significant political force with karl marx being a leading figure and a member of its general council bakunin s faction the jura federation and proudhon s followers the mutualists opposed state socialism advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings after bitter disputes the bakuninists were expelled from the international by the marxists at the one eight seven two hague congress anarchists were treated similarly in the second international being ultimately expelled in one eight nine six bakunin famously predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by marx s terms they would end up the new tyrants of workers in response to their expulsion from the first international anarchists formed the st imier international under the influence of peter kropotkin a russian philosopher and scientist anarcho communism overlapped with collectivism anarcho communists who drew inspiration from the one eight seven one paris commune advocated for free federation and for the distribution of goods according to one s needs at the turn of the century anarchism had spread all over the world it was a notable feature of the international syndicalism movement in china small groups of students imported the humanistic pro science version of anarcho communism tokyo was a hotspot for rebellious youth from countries of the far east travelling to the japanese capital to study in latin america argentina was a stronghold for anarcho syndicalism where it became the most prominent left wing ideology during this time a minority of anarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary political violence this strategy became known as propaganda of the deed the dismemberment of the french socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies following the suppression of the paris commune favoured individualist political expression and acts even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts infamy came upon the movement and attempts were made to exclude them from american immigration including the immigration act of one nine zero three also called the anarchist exclusion act illegalism was another strategy which some anarchists adopted during this period nestor makhno seen with members of the anarchist revolutionary insurrectionary army of ukraine despite concerns anarchists enthusiastically participated in the russian revolution in opposition to the white movement however they met harsh suppression after the bolshevik government was stabilised several anarchists from petrograd and moscow fled to ukraine notably leading to the kronstadt rebellion and nestor makhno s struggle in the free territory with the anarchists being crushed in russia two new antithetical currents emerged namely platformism and synthesis anarchism the former sought to create a coherent group that would push for revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party seeing the victories of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war many workers and activists turned to communist parties which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements in france and the united states members of major syndicalist movements such as the general confederation of labour and the industrial workers of the world left their organisations and joined the communist international in the spanish civil war of one nine three six anarchists and syndicalists cnt and fai once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists a long tradition of spanish anarchism led to anarchists playing a pivotal role in the war in response to the army rebellion an anarchist inspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivised the land the soviet union provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war but the result was a bitter fight among communists and anarchists at a series of events named may days as joseph stalin tried to seize control of the republicans post war era rojava s support efforts for workers to form cooperatives is exemplified in this sewing cooperative at the end of world war ii the anarchist movement was severely weakened the one nine six zero s witnessed a revival of anarchism likely caused by a perceived failure of marxism leninism and tensions built by the cold war during this time anarchism found a presence in other movements critical towards both capitalism and the state such as the anti nuclear environmental and peace movements the counterculture of the one nine six zero s and the new left it also saw a transition from its previous revolutionary nature to provocative anti capitalist reformism anarchism became associated with punk subculture as exemplified by bands such as crass and the sex pistols the established feminist tendencies of anarcha feminism returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism black anarchism began to take form at this time and influenced anarchism s move from a eurocentric demographic this coincided with its failure to gain traction in northern europe and its unprecedented height in latin america around the turn of the two one st century anarchism grew in popularity and influence within anti capitalist anti war and anti globalisation movements anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the world trade organization wto the group of eight and the world economic forum during the protests ad hoc leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs engaged in rioting property destruction and violent confrontations with the police other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include affinity groups security culture and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet a significant event of this period was the confrontations at the one nine nine nine seattle wto conference anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the zapatistas in mexico and the democratic federation of northern syria more commonly known as rojava a de facto autonomous region in northern syria thought anarchist schools of thought have been generally grouped into two main historical traditions social anarchism and individualist anarchism owing to their different origins values and evolution the individualist current emphasises negative liberty in opposing restraints upon the free individual while the social current emphasises positive liberty in aiming to achieve the free potential of society through equality and social ownership in a chronological sense anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late one nine th century and the post classical currents anarcha feminism green anarchism and post anarchism developed thereafter beyond the specific factions of anarchist movements which constitute political anarchism lies philosophical anarchism which holds that the state lacks moral legitimacy without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it a component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of a minimal state but claims that citizens have no moral obligation to obey government when it conflicts with individual autonomy anarchism pays significant attention to moral arguments since ethics have a central role in anarchist philosophy anarchism s emphasis on anti capitalism egalitarianism and for the extension of community and individuality sets it apart from anarcho capitalism and other types of economic libertarianism anarchism is usually placed on the far left of the political spectrum much of its economics and legal philosophy reflect anti authoritarian anti statist libertarian and radical interpretations of left wing and socialist politics such as collectivism communism individualism mutualism and syndicalism among other libertarian socialist economic theories as anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview many anarchist types and traditions exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely one reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives a call for toleration and unity among anarchists first adopted by fernando tarrida del m rmol in one eight eight nine in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time belief in political nihilism has been espoused by anarchists despite separation the various anarchist schools of thought are not seen as distinct entities but rather as tendencies that intermingle and are connected through a set of uniform principles such as individual and local autonomy mutual aid network organisation communal democracy justified authority and decentralisation classical upright pierre joseph proudhon is the primary proponent of mutualism and influenced many future individualist anarchist and social anarchist thinkers inceptive currents among classical anarchist currents were mutualism and individualism they were followed by the major currents of social anarchism collectivist communist and syndicalist they differ on organisational and economic aspects of their ideal society mutualism is an one eight th century economic theory that was developed into anarchist theory by pierre joseph proudhon its aims include reciprocity free association voluntary contract federation and monetary reform of both credit and currency that would be regulated by a bank of the people mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism in what is property one eight four zero proudhon first characterised his goal as a third form of society the synthesis of communism and property collectivist anarchism is a revolutionary socialist form of anarchism commonly associated with mikhail bakunin collectivist anarchists advocate collective ownership of the means of production which is theorised to be achieved through violent revolution and that workers be paid according to time worked rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism collectivist anarchism arose alongside marxism but rejected the dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society anarcho communism is a theory of anarchism that advocates a communist society with common ownership of the means of production direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations workers councils and worker cooperatives with production and consumption based on the guiding principle from each according to his ability to each according to his need anarcho communism developed from radical socialist currents after the french revolution but was first formulated as such in the italian section of the first international it was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of peter kropotkin whose specific style would go onto become the dominating view of anarchists by the late one nine th century anarcho syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that views labour syndicates as a potential force for revolutionary social change replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self managed by workers the basic principles of anarcho syndicalism are direct action workers solidarity and workers self management individualist anarchism is a set of several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants early influences on individualist forms of anarchism include william godwin max stirner and henry david thoreau through many countries individualist anarchism attracted a small yet diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation post classical and contemporary lawrence jarach left and john zerzan right are two prominent contemporary anarchist authors with zerzan being a prominent voice within anarcho primitivism and jarach a notable advocate of post left anarchy anarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the anti globalisation movement whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation as the movement shaped two one st century radicalism wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest anarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movements at times eclectic drawing upon various sources and combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches the anti capitalist tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within contemporary currents contemporary news coverage which emphasizes black bloc demonstrations has reinforced anarchism s historical association with chaos and violence its publicity has also led more scholars in fields such as anthropology and history to engage with the anarchist movement although contemporary anarchism favours actions over academic theory various anarchist groups tendencies and schools of thought exist today making it difficult to describe the contemporary anarchist movement while theorists and activists have established relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles there is no consensus on which principles are core and commentators describe multiple anarchisms rather than a singular anarchism in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently gender equality can be a common principle although it ranks as a higher priority to anarcha feminists than anarcho communists anarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in all forms namely all centralized and hierarchical forms of government e g monarchy representative democracy state socialism etc economic class systems e g capitalism bolshevism feudalism slavery etc autocratic religions e g fundamentalist islam roman catholicism etc patriarchy heterosexism white supremacy and imperialism anarchist schools disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed the principle of equal liberty is closer to anarchist political ethics in that it transcends both the liberal and socialist traditions this entails that liberty and equality cannot be implemented within the state resulting in the questioning of all forms of domination and hierarchy tactics anarchists tactics take various forms but in general serve two major goals namely to first oppose the establishment and secondly to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society illustrating the unity of means and ends a broad categorisation can be made between aims to destroy oppressive states and institutions by revolutionary means on one hand and aims to change society through evolutionary means on the other evolutionary tactics embrace nonviolence reject violence and take a gradual approach to anarchist aims although there is significant overlap between the two anarchist tactics have shifted during the course of the last century anarchists during the early two zero th century focused more on strikes and militancy while contemporary anarchists use a broader array of approaches classical era tactics the relationship between anarchism and violence is a controversial subject among anarchists as shown by anarchist leon czolgosz assassinating william mckinley during the classical era anarchists had a militant tendency not only did they confront state armed forces as in spain and ukraine but some of them also employed terrorism as propaganda of the deed assassination attempts were carried out against heads of state some of which were successful anarchists also took part in revolutions many anarchists especially the galleanists believed that these attempts would be the impetus for a revolution against capitalism and the state many of these attacks were done by individual assailants and the majority took place in the late one eight seven zero s the early one eight eight zero s and the one eight nine zero s with some still occurring in the early one nine zero zero s their decrease in prevalence was the result of further judicial power and targeting and cataloging by state institutions anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been controversial anarcho pacifists advocate for non violence means to achieve their stateless nonviolent ends other anarchist groups advocate direct action a tactic which can include acts of sabotage or terrorism this attitude was quite prominent a century ago when seeing the state as a tyrant and some anarchists believing that they had every right to oppose its oppression by any means possible emma goldman and errico malatesta who were proponents of limited use of violence stated that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a necessary evil anarchists took an active role in strike actions although they tended to be antipathetic to formal syndicalism seeing it as reformist they saw it as a part of the movement which sought to overthrow the state and capitalism anarchists also reinforced their propaganda within the arts some of whom practiced naturism and nudism those anarchists also built communities which were based on friendship and were involved in the news media revolutionary tactics black bloc protesters parading anarcho communism imagery such as the motto no war but the class war in the current era italian anarchist alfredo bonanno a proponent of insurrectionary anarchism has reinstated the debate on violence by rejecting the nonviolence tactic adopted since the late one nine th century by kropotkin and other prominent anarchists afterwards both bonanno and the french group the invisible committee advocate for small informal affiliation groups where each member is responsible for their own actions but works together to bring down oppression utilizing sabotage and other violent means against state capitalism and other enemies members of the invisible committee were arrested in two zero zero eight on various charges terrorism included overall contemporary anarchists are much less violent and militant than their ideological ancestors they mostly engage in confronting the police during demonstrations and riots especially in countries such as canada greece and mexico militant black bloc protest groups are known for clashing with the police however anarchists not only clash with state operators they also engage in the struggle against fascists and racists taking anti fascist action and mobilizing to prevent hate rallies from happening evolutionary tactics anarchists commonly employ direct action this can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust hierarchy or the form of self managing their lives through the creation of counter institutions such as communes and non hierarchical collectives decision making is often handled in an anti authoritarian way with everyone having equal say in each decision an approach known as horizontalism contemporary era anarchists have been engaging with various grassroots movements that are more or less based on horizontalism although not explicitly anarchist respecting personal autonomy and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations in contrast with the big a anarchism of the classical era the newly coined term small a anarchism signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on classical era anarchism or to refer to classical anarchists such as peter kropotkin and pierre joseph proudhon to justify their opinions those anarchists would rather base their thought and praxis on their own experience which they will later theorize the decision making process of small anarchist affinity groups plays a significant tactical role anarchists have employed various methods in order to build a rough consensus among members of their group without the need of a leader or a leading group one way is for an individual from the group to play the role of facilitator to help achieve a consensus without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting a specific point minorities usually accept rough consensus except when they feel the proposal contradicts anarchist ethics goals and values anarchists usually form small groups five two zero individuals to enhance autonomy and friendships among their members these kinds of groups more often than not interconnect with each other forming larger networks anarchists still support and participate in strikes especially wildcat strikes as these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by a syndicate as in the past newspapers and journals are used and anarchists have gone online in the world wide web to spread their message anarchists have found it easier to create websites because of distributional and other difficulties hosting electronic libraries and other portals anarchists were also involved in developing various software that are available for free the way these hacktivists work to develop and distribute resembles the anarchist ideals especially when it comes to preserving users privacy from state surveillance anarchists organize themselves to squat and reclaim public spaces during important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied they are often called temporary autonomous zones taz spaces where art poetry and surrealism are blended to display the anarchist ideal as seen by anarchists squatting is a way to regain urban space from the capitalist market serving pragmatical needs and also being an exemplary direct action acquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with their ideas and build social bonds adding up these tactics while having in mind that not all anarchists share the same attitudes towards them along with various forms of protesting at highly symbolic events make up a carnivalesque atmosphere that is part of contemporary anarchist vividity key issues as anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes tendencies and schools of thought disagreement over questions of values ideology and tactics is common its diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has created a number of definitional concerns in anarchist theory the compatibility of capitalism nationalism and religion with anarchism is widely disputed and anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as communism collectivism marxism and trade unionism anarchists may be motivated by humanism divine authority enlightened self interest veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines phenomena such as civilisation technology e g within anarcho primitivism and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others gender sexuality and free love upright mile armand was a french individualist anarchist who propounded the virtues of free love in the parisian anarchist milieu of the early two zero th century as gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy many anarchists address analyse and oppose the suppression of one s autonomy imposed by gender roles upright one two collection of anarcha feminist protests symbols and flags sexuality was not often discussed by classical anarchists but the few that did felt that an anarchist society would lead to sexuality naturally developing sexual violence was a concern for anarchists such as benjamin tucker who opposed age of consent laws believing they would benefit predatory men a historical current that arose and flourished during one eight nine zero and one nine two zero within anarchism was free love in contemporary anarchism this current survives as a tendency to support polyamory and queer anarchism free love advocates were against marriage which they saw as a way of men imposing authority over women largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men the notion of free love was much broader and included a critique of the established order that limited women s sexual freedom and pleasure those free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses where large groups of travelers anarchists and other activists slept in beds together free love had roots both in europe and the united states however some anarchists struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love anarchist feminists were advocates of free love against marriage and pro choice utilising a contemporary term and had a similar agenda anarchist and non anarchist feminists differed on suffrage but were supportive of one another during the second half of the two zero th century anarchism intermingled with the second wave of feminism radicalising some currents of the feminist movement and being influenced as well by the latest decades of the two zero th century anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women gays queers and other marginalised groups with some feminist thinkers suggesting a fusion of the two currents with the third wave of feminism sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality became a subject of study for anarchists yielding a post structuralist critique of sexual normality some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking suggesting that it leaned towards an individualism that was dropping the cause of social liberation anarchism and education the interest of anarchists in education stretches back to the first emergence of classical anarchism anarchists consider proper education one which sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and the society to be an act of mutual aid anarchist writers such as william godwin political justice and max stirner the false principle of our education attacked both state education and private education as another means by which the ruling class replicate their privileges in one nine zero one catalan anarchist and free thinker francisco ferrer established the escuela moderna in barcelona as an opposition to the established education system which was dictated largely by the catholic church ferrer s approach was secular rejecting both state and church involvement in the educational process whilst giving pupils large amounts of autonomy in planning their work and attendance ferrer aimed to educate the working class and explicitly sought to foster class consciousness among students the school closed after constant harassment by the state and ferrer was later arrested nonetheless his ideas formed the inspiration for a series of modern schools around the world christian anarchist leo tolstoy who published the essay education and culture also established a similar school with its founding principle being that for education to be effective it had to be free in a similar token a s neill founded what became the summerhill school in one nine two one also declaring being free from coercion anarchist education is based largely on the idea that a child s right to develop freely and without manipulation ought to be respected and that rationality would lead children to morally good conclusions however there has been little consensus among anarchist figures as to what constitutes manipulation ferrer believed that moral indoctrination was necessary and explicitly taught pupils that equality liberty and social justice were not possible under capitalism along with other critiques of government and nationalism late two zero th century and contemporary anarchist writers paul goodman herbert read and colin ward intensified and expanded the anarchist critique of state education largely focusing on the need for a system that focuses on children s creativity rather than on their ability to attain a career or participate in consumerism as part of a consumer society contemporary anarchists such as ward claim that state education serves to perpetuate socioeconomic inequality while few anarchist education institutions have survived to the modern day major tenets of anarchist schools among them respect for child autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as a teaching method have spread among mainstream educational institutions judith suissa names three schools as explicitly anarchists schools namely the free skool santa cruz in the united states which is part of a wider american canadian network of schools the self managed learning college in brighton england and the paideia school in spain anarchism and the state objection to the state and its institutions is a sine qua non of anarchism anarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and believe it to be illegitimate regardless of its political tendencies instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life major decisions are taken by a small elite authority ultimately rests solely on power regardless of whether that power is open or transparent as it still has the ability to coerce people another anarchist argument against states is that the people constituting a government even the most altruistic among officials will unavoidably seek to gain more power leading to corruption anarchists consider the idea that the state is the collective will of the people to be an unachievable fiction due to the fact that the ruling class is distinct from the rest of society specific anarchist attitudes towards the state vary robert paul wolff believed that the tension between authority and autonomy would mean the state could never be legitimate bakunin saw the state as meaning coercion domination by means of coercion camouflaged if possible but unceremonious and overt if need be a john simmons and leslie green who leaned toward philosophical anarchism believed that the state could be legitimate if it is governed by consensus although they saw this as highly unlikely beliefs on how to abolish the state also differ anarchism and the arts les chataigniers a osny one eight eight eight by anarchist painter camille pissarro is a notable example of blending anarchism and the arts the connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism especially among artistic currents that were developing during that era such as futurists surrealists and others in literature anarchism was mostly associated with the new apocalyptics and the neo romanticism movement in music anarchism has been associated with music scenes such as punk anarchists such as leo tolstoy and herbert read stated that the border between the artist and the non artist what separates art from a daily act is a construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism and it prevents humans from living a joyful life other anarchists advocated for or used art as a means to achieve anarchist ends in his book breaking the spell a history of anarchist filmmakers videotape guerrillas and digital ninjas chris rob claims that anarchist inflected practices have increasingly structured movement based video activism throughout the two zero th century many prominent anarchists peter kropotkin emma goldman gustav landauer and camillo berneri and publications such as anarchy wrote about matters pertaining to the arts three overlapping properties made art useful to anarchists it could depict a critique of existing society and hierarchies serve as a prefigurative tool to reflect the anarchist ideal society and even turn into a means of direct action such as in protests as it appeals to both emotion and reason art could appeal to the whole human and have a powerful effect the one nine th century neo impressionist movement had an ecological aesthetic and offered an example of an anarchist perception of the road towards socialism in les chataigniers a osny by anarchist painter camille pissarro the blending of aesthetic and social harmony is prefiguring an ideal anarchistic agrarian community analysis the most common critique of anarchism is that humans cannot self govern and so a state is necessary for human survival philosopher bertrand russell supported this critique stating that peace and war tariffs regulations of sanitary conditions and the sale of noxious drugs the preservation of a just system of distribution these among others are functions which could hardly be performed in a community in which there was no central government another common criticism of anarchism is that it fits a world of isolation in which only the small enough entities can be self governing a response would be that major anarchist thinkers advocated anarchist federalism philosophy lecturer andrew g fiala composed a list of common arguments against anarchism which includes critiques such as that anarchism is innately related to violence and destruction not only in the pragmatic world such as at protests but in the world of ethics as well secondly anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian since the state cannot be defeated practically this line of arguments most often calls for political action within the system to reform it the third argument is that anarchism is self contradictory while it advocates for no one to archiei if accepted by the many then anarchism would turn into the ruling political theory in this line of criticism also comes the self contradiction that anarchism calls for collective action whilst endorsing the autonomy of the individual hence no collective action can be taken lastly fiala mentions a critique towards philosophical anarchism of being ineffective all talk and thoughts and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong philosophical anarchism has met the criticism of members of academia following the release of pro anarchist books such as a john simmons moral principles and political obligations law professor william a edmundson authored an essay to argue against three major philosophical anarchist principles which he finds fallacious edmundson says that while the individual does not owe the state a duty of obedience this does not imply that anarchism is the inevitable conclusion and the state is still morally legitimate in the problem of political authority michael huemer defends philosophical anarchism claiming that political authority is a moral illusion one of the earliest criticisms is that anarchism defies and fails to understand the biological inclination to authority joseph raz states that the acceptance of authority implies the belief that following their instructions will afford more success raz believes that this argument is true in following both authorities successful and mistaken instruction anarchists reject this criticism because challenging or disobeying authority does not entail the disappearance of its advantages by acknowledging authority such as doctors or lawyers as reliable nor does it involve a complete surrender of independent judgment anarchist perception of human nature rejection of the state and commitment to social revolution has been criticised by academics as naive overly simplistic and unrealistic respectively classical anarchism has been criticised for relying too heavily on the belief that the abolition of the state will lead to human cooperation prospering friedrich engels considered to be one of the principal founders of marxism criticised anarchism s anti authoritarianism as inherently counter revolutionary because in his view a revolution is by itself authoritarian academic john molyneux writes in his book anarchism a marxist criticism that anarchism cannot win believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas the marxist criticism of anarchism is that it has a utopian character because all individuals should have anarchist views and values according to the marxist view that a social idea would follow directly from this human ideal and out of the free will of every individual formed its essence marxists state that this contradiction was responsible for their inability to act in the anarchist vision the conflict between liberty and

characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication and by restricted and repetitive behavior parents often notice signs during the first three years of their child s life these signs often develop gradually though some autistic children experience regression in their communication and social skills after reaching developmental milestones at a normal pace autism is associated with a combination of genetic and environmental factors risk factors during pregnancy include certain infections such as rubella toxins including valproic acid alcohol cocaine pesticides lead and air pollution fetal growth restriction and autoimmune diseases controversies surround other proposed environmental causes for example the vaccine hypothesis which has been disproven autism affects information processing in the brain and how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize how this occurs is not well understood the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders dsm five combines forms of the condition including asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified pdd nos into the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder asd several interventions have been shown to reduce symptoms and improve the ability of autistic people to function and participate independently in the community behavioral psychological education and or skill building interventions may be used to assist autistic people to learn life skills necessary for living independently as well as other social communication and language skills therapy also aims to reduce challenging behaviors and build upon strengths some autistic adults are unable to live independently an autistic culture has developed with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference to be accommodated instead of cured globally autism is estimated to affect two four eight million people in the two zero zero zero s the number of autistic people worldwide was estimated at one two per one zero zero zero people in the developed countries about one five of children are diagnosed with asd from zero seven in two zero zero zero in the united states it is diagnosed four to five times more often in males than females the number of people diagnosed has increased considerably since the one nine nine zero s which may be partly due to increased recognition of the condition characteristics autism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder whose symptoms first appear during infancy or childhood and generally follows a steady course without remission autistic people may be severely impaired in some respects but average or even superior in others overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood although often in more muted form it is distinguished by a characteristic triad of symptoms impairments in social interaction impairments in communication and repetitive behavior other aspects such as atypical eating are also common but are not essential for diagnosis individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits social development social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders asd see classification from other developmental disorders autistic people have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted noted autistic temple grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals or people with typical neural development as leaving her feeling like an anthropologist on mars unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli smile and look at others less often and respond less to their own name autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms for example they have less eye contact and turn taking and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves such as pointing at things three to five year old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding approach others spontaneously imitate and respond to emotions communicate nonverbally and take turns with others however they do form attachments to their primary caregivers most autistic children display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less pronounced autistic traits older children and adults with asd perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person s own emotions children with high functioning autism have more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non autistic peers despite the common belief that autistic children prefer to be alone making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for autistic people for them the quality of friendships not the number of friends predicts how lonely they feel functional friendships such as those resulting in invitations to parties may affect the quality of life more deeply there are many anecdotal reports but few systematic studies of aggression and violence in individuals with asd the limited data suggest that in children with intellectual disability autism is associated with aggression destruction of property and meltdowns communication about one third to half of autistic people do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs differences in communication may be present from the first year of life and may include delayed onset of babbling unusual gestures diminished responsiveness and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver in the second and third years autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling consonants words and word combinations their gestures are less often integrated with words autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences and are more likely to simply repeat others words echolalia or reverse pronouns joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with asd for example they may look at a pointing hand instead of the object to which the hand is pointing and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language in a pair of studies high functioning autistic children aged eight one five performed equally well as and as adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language comprehension and inference as people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends repetitive behavior alt sleeping boy beside a dozen or so toys arranged in a line a young autistic boy who has arranged his toys in a row autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior which the repetitive behavior scale revised rbs r categorizes as follows stereotyped behaviors repetitive movements such as hand flapping head rolling or body rocking compulsive behaviors time consuming behaviors intended to reduce the anxiety that an individual feels compelled to perform repeatedly or according to rigid rules such as placing objects in a specific order checking things or handwashing sameness resistance to change for example insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted ritualistic behavior unvarying pattern of daily activities such as an unchanging menu or a dressing ritual this is closely associated with sameness and an independent validation has suggested combining the two factors restricted interests interests or fixations that are abnormal in theme or intensity of focus such as preoccupation with a single television program toy or game self injury behaviors such as eye poking skin picking hand biting and head banging no single repetitive or self injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors other symptoms autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis but that can affect the individual or the family an estimated zero five to one zero of individuals with asd show unusual abilities ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants many individuals with asd show superior skills in perception and attention relative to the general population sensory abnormalities are found in over nine zero of autistic people and are considered core features by some although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders differences are greater for under responsivity for example walking into things than for over responsivity for example distress from loud noises or for sensation seeking for example rhythmic movements an estimated six zero eight zero of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone poor motor planning and toe walking deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across asd and are greater in autism proper unusual eating behavior occurs in about three quarters of children with asd to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator selectivity is the most common problem although eating rituals and food refusal also occur there is tentative evidence that gender dysphoria occurs more frequently in autistic people see autism and lgbt identities as well as that a two zero two one anonymized online survey of one six nine zero year olds revealed that autistic males are more likely to be bisexual while autistic females are more likely to be homosexual gastrointestinal problems are one of the most commonly co occurring medical conditions in autistic people these are linked to greater social impairment irritability behavior and sleep problems language impairments and mood changes parents of children with asd have higher levels of stress siblings of children with asd report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship however they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with down syndrome siblings of individuals with asd have greater risk of negative well being and poorer sibling relationships as adults causes it has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic cognitive and neural levels for autism s characteristic triad of symptoms however there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co occur alt three diagrams of chromosome pairs a b that are nearly identical one b is missing a segment of a two b has two adjacent copies of a segment of a three b s copy of a s segment is in reverse order deletion one duplication two and inversion three are all chromosome abnormalities that have been implicated in autism autism has a strong genetic basis although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by rare mutations with major effects or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes the environment and epigenetic factors which do not change dna sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents studies of twins suggest that heritability is zero seven for autism and as high as zero nine for asd and siblings of those with autism are about two five times more likely to be autistic than the general population however most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified typically autism cannot be traced to a mendelian single gene mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality and none of the genetic syndromes associated with asds have been shown to selectively cause asd numerous candidate genes have been located with only small effects attributable to any particular gene most loci individually explain less than one of cases of autism the large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous structural variation such as deletions duplications or inversions in genetic material during meiosis hence a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited that is the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome autism may be underdiagnosed in women and girls due to an assumption that it is primarily a male condition but genetic phenomena such as imprinting and x linkage have the ability to raise the frequency and severity of conditions in males and theories have been put forward for a genetic reason why males are diagnosed more often such as the imprinted brain hypothesis and the extreme male brain theory maternal nutrition and inflammation during preconception and pregnancy influences fetal neurodevelopment intrauterine growth restriction is associated with asd in both term and preterm infants maternal inflammatory and autoimmune diseases may damage fetal tissues aggravating a genetic problem or damaging the nervous system exposure to air pollution during pregnancy especially heavy metals and particulates may increase the risk of autism environmental factors that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods infectious diseases solvents pcbs phthalates and phenols used in plastic products pesticides brominated flame retardants alcohol smoking illicit drugs vaccines and prenatal stress some such as the mmr vaccine have been completely disproven parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination this has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine overload a vaccine preservative or the mmr vaccine for causing autism the latter theory was supported by a litigation funded study that has since been shown to have been an elaborate fraud although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries and the preventable deaths of several children mechanism autism s symptoms result from maturation related changes in various systems of the brain how autism occurs is not well understood its mechanism can be divided into two areas the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors the behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies there is evidence that gut brain axis abnormalities may be involved a two zero one five review proposed that immune dysregulation gastrointestinal inflammation malfunction of the autonomic nervous system gut flora alterations and food metabolites may cause brain neuroinflammation and dysfunction a two zero one six review concludes that enteric nervous system abnormalities might play a role in neurological disorders such as autism neural connections and the immune system are a pathway that may allow diseases originated in the intestine to spread to the brain several lines of evidence point to synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways such as those involved with cell adhesion gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity dependent changes all known teratogens agents that cause birth defects related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from conception and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development diagnosis diagnosis is based on behavior not cause or mechanism under the dsm five autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts as well as restricted repetitive patterns of behavior interests or activities these deficits are present in early childhood typically before age three and lead to clinically significant functional impairment sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects the disturbance must not be better accounted for by rett syndrome intellectual disability or global developmental delay icd one zero uses essentially the same definition several diagnostic instruments are available two are commonly used in autism research the autism diagnostic interview revised adi r is a semistructured parent interview and the autism diagnostic observation schedule ados uses observation and interaction with the child the childhood autism rating scale cars is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children the diagnostic interview for social and communication disorders disco may also be used a pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child if warranted diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from asd specialists observing and assessing cognitive communication family and other factors using standardized tools and taking into account any associated medical conditions a pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions a differential diagnosis for asd at this stage might also consider intellectual disability hearing impairment and a specific language impairment such as landau kleffner syndrome the presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression clinical genetics evaluations are often done once asd is diagnosed particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated four zero of cases to genetic causes consensus guidelines in the us and uk are limited to high resolution chromosome and fragile x testing a genotype first model of diagnosis has been proposed which would routinely assess the genome s copy number variations as new genetic tests are developed several ethical legal and social issues will emerge commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results given the complexity of autism s genetics metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful but are not routine asd can sometimes be diagnosed by age one four months although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life for example a one year old who meets diagnostic criteria for asd is less likely than a three year old to continue to do so a few years later in the uk the national autism plan for children recommends at most three zero weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment though few cases are handled that quickly in practice although the symptoms of autism and asd begin early in childhood they are sometimes missed years later adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves to help their employers make adjustments or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits signs of autism may be more challenging for clinicians to detect in females autistic females have been shown to engage in masking more frequently than autistic males masking may include making oneself perform normative facial expressions and eye contact a notable percentage of autistic females may be misdiagnosed diagnosed after a considerable delay or not diagnosed at all conversely the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis it is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or blindisms classification autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders pdd which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior these symptoms do not imply sickness fragility or emotional disturbance of the five pdd forms asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated causes pdd not otherwise specified pdd nos also called atypical autism is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder unlike with autism people with asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development the terminology of autism can be bewildering with autism asperger syndrome and pdd nos often called the autism spectrum disorders asd or sometimes the autistic disorders whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder childhood autism or infantile autism in this article autism refers to the classic autistic disorder in clinical practice though autism asd and pdd are often used interchangeably asd in turn is a subset of the broader autism phenotype which describes individuals who may not have asd but do have autistic like traits such as avoiding eye contact research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry psychology neurology and pediatrics newer technologies such as fmri and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes observable traits that can be viewed on brain scans to help further neurogenetic studies of autism one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects it has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior for more see brett abrahams geneticist and neuroscientist spectrum autism has long been thought to cover a wide spectrum ranging from individuals with severe impairments who may be silent developmentally disabled and prone to frequent repetitive behavior such as hand flapping and rocking to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches narrowly focused interests and verbose pedantic communication because the behavior spectrum is continuous boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary screening about half of parents of children with asd notice their child s unusual behaviors by age one eight months and about four fifths notice by age two four months according to an article failure to meet any of the following milestones is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long term outcome no response to name or eye to eye gaze by six months no babbling by one two months no gesturing pointing waving etc by one two months no single words by one six months no two word spontaneous not just echolalic phrases by two four months loss of any language or social skills at any age the united states preventive services task force in two zero one six found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concern the japanese practice is to screen all children for asd at one eight and two four months using autism specific formal screening tests in contrast in the uk children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened it is not known which approach is more effective screening tools include the modified checklist for autism in toddlers m chat the early screening of autistic traits questionnaire and the first year inventory initial data on m chat and its predecessor the checklist for autism in toddlers chat on children aged one eight three zero months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity many false negatives but good specificity few false positives it may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish asd from other developmental disorders screening tools designed for one culture s norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture although genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical it can be considered in some cases such as children with neurological symptoms and dysmorphic features some authors suggest that automatic motor assessment could be useful to screen the children with asd for instance with behavioural motor and emotionals reactions during smartphone watching prevention while infection with rubella during pregnancy causes fewer than one of cases of autism vaccination against rubella can prevent many of those cases management alt a young child points in front of a woman who smiles and points in the same direction an autistic three year old points to fish in an aquarium as part of an experiment on the effect of intensive shared attention training on language development the main goals when treating autistic children are to lessen associated deficits and family distress and to increase quality of life and functional independence in general higher iqs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes no single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child s needs families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment services should be carried out by behavior analysts special education teachers speech pathologists and licensed psychologists studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy however the development of evidence based interventions has advanced in recent years although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor their clinical results are mostly tentative and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options intensive sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self care communication and job skills and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated while medications have not been found to help with core symptoms they may be used for associated symptoms such as irritability inattention or repetitive behavior patterns education educational interventions often used include applied behavior analysis aba developmental models structured teaching speech and language therapy social skills therapy and occupational therapy and cognitive behavioral interventions in adults without intellectual disability to reduce depression anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder among these approaches interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit the quality of research for early intensive behavioral intervention eibi a treatment procedure incorporating over thirty hours per week of the structured type of aba that is carried out with very young children is currently low and more vigorous research designs with larger sample sizes are needed two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include structured and naturalistic aba interventions and developmental social pragmatic models dsp one interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model which teaches parents how to implement various aba and dsp techniques allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves various dsp programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at home parent implementation despite the recent development of parent training models these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment welsh government s code of practice on provision of autism services early intensive aba therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing communication and adaptive functioning in preschool children it is also well established for improving the intellectual performance of that age group similarly a teacher implemented intervention that utilizes a more naturalistic form of aba combined with a developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be beneficial in improving social communication skills in young children although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided it is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results the appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers medication medications may be used to treat asd symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails they may also be used for associated health problems such as adhd or anxiety more than half of us children diagnosed with asd are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants with the most common drug classes being antidepressants stimulants and antipsychotics the atypical antipsychotic drugs risperidone and aripiprazole are fda approved for treating associated aggressive and self injurious behaviors however their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits and autistic people may respond atypically side effects for example may include weight gain tiredness drooling and aggression ssri antidepressants such as fluoxetine and fluvoxamine have been shown to be effective in reducing repetitive and ritualistic behaviors while the stimulant medication methylphenidate is beneficial for some children with co morbid inattentiveness or hyperactivity there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with asd no known medication relieves autism s core symptoms of social and communication impairments experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism alternative medicine although many alternative therapies and interventions are available few are supported by scientific studies treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality of life contexts and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real world relevance some alternative treatments may place the child at risk the preference that autistic children have for unconventional foods can lead to reduction in bone cortical thickness with this being greater in those on casein free diets as a consequence of the low intake of calcium and vitamin d however suboptimal bone development in asd has also been associated with lack of exercise and gastrointestinal disorders in two zero zero five botched chelation therapy killed a five year old child with autism chelation is not recommended for autistic people since the associated risks outweigh any potential benefits another alternative medicine practice with no evidence is cease therapy a mixture of homeopathy supplements and vaccine detoxing although popularly used as an alternative treatment for autistic people as of two zero one eight there is no good evidence to recommend a gluten and casein free diet as a standard treatment a two zero one eight review concluded that it may be a therapeutic option for specific groups of children with autism such as those with known food intolerances or allergies or with food intolerance markers the authors analyzed the prospective trials conducted to date that studied the efficacy of the gluten and casein free diet in children with asd four in total all of them compared gluten and casein free diet versus normal diet with a control group two double blind randomized controlled trials one double blind crossover trial one single blind trial in two of the studies whose duration was one two and two four months a significant improvement in asd symptoms efficacy rate five zero was identified in the other two studies whose duration was three months no significant effect was observed the authors concluded that a longer duration of the diet may be necessary to achieve the improvement of the asd symptoms other problems documented in the trials carried out include transgressions of the diet small sample size the heterogeneity of the participants and the possibility of a placebo effect in the subset of people who have gluten sensitivity there is limited evidence that suggests that a gluten free diet may improve some autistic behaviors results of a systematic review on interventions to address health outcomes among autistic adults found emerging evidence to support mindfulness based interventions for improving mental health this includes decreasing stress anxiety ruminating thoughts anger and aggression there is tentative evidence that music therapy may improve social interactions verbal communication and non verbal communication skills there has been early research looking at hyperbaric treatments in children with autism studies on pet therapy have shown positive effects prognosis there is no known cure for autism the degree of symptoms can decrease occasionally to the extent that people lose their diagnosis of asd this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not it is not known how often this outcome happens reported rates in unselected samples have ranged from three to two five most autistic children acquire language by age five or younger though a few have developed communication skills in later years many autistic children lack social support future employment opportunities or self determination although core difficulties tend to persist symptoms often become less severe with age few high quality studies address long term prognosis some adults show modest improvement in communication skills but a few decline no study has focused on autism after midlife acquiring language before age six having an iq above five zero and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes independent living is unlikely with severe autism many autistic people face significant obstacles in transitioning to adulthood compared to the general population autistic people are more likely to be unemployed and to have never had a job about half of people in their two zero s with autism are not employed autistic people tend to face increased stress levels related to psychosocial factors such as stigma which may increase the rates of mental health issues in the autistic population epidemiology alt bar chart versus time the graph rises steadily from one nine nine six to two zero zero seven from about zero seven to about five three the trend curves slightly upward reports of autism cases per one zero zero zero children rose considerably in the us from one nine nine six to two zero zero seven it is unknown how much growth came from changes in rates of autism as of two zero zero seven reviews estimate a prevalence of one two per one zero zero zero for autism and close to six per one zero zero zero for asd a two zero one six survey in the united states reported a rate of two five per one zero zero zero children for asd globally autism affects an estimated two four eight million people while asperger syndrome affects a further three seven two million in two zero one two the nhs estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged one eight years and over in the uk was one one rates of pdd nos s has been estimated at three seven per one zero zero zero asperger syndrome at roughly zero six per one zero zero zero and childhood disintegrative disorder at zero zero two per one zero zero zero cdc estimates about one out of five nine one seven for two zero one four an increase from one out of every six eight children one five for two zero one zero in the uk from one nine nine eight to two zero one eight the autism diagnoses increased by seven eight seven this increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices referral patterns availability of services age at diagnosis and public awareness particularly among women though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out the available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism s true prevalence has increased a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward psychosocial factors and changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics it has been established that vaccination is not a risk factor for autism and is not behind any increase in autism prevalence rates if any change in the rate of autism exists at all males are at higher risk for asd than females the sex ratio averages four three one and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment it may be close to two one with intellectual disability and more than five five one without several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed one theory is that females are underdiagnosed although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy related risk factor as a cause of autism the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent and with diabetes bleeding and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy the risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism most professionals believe that race ethnicity and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism several other conditions are common in children with autism they include genetic disorders about one zero one five of autism cases have an identifiable mendelian single gene condition chromosome abnormality or other genetic syndrome and asd is associated with several genetic disorders intellectual disability the percentage of autistic individuals who also meet criteria for intellectual disability has been reported as anywhere from two five to seven zero a wide variation illustrating the difficulty of assessing intelligence of individuals on the autism spectrum in comparison for pdd nos the association with intellectual disability is much weaker and by definition the diagnosis of asperger s excludes intellectual disability anxiety disorders are common among children with asd there are no firm data but studies have reported prevalences ranging from one one to eight four many anxiety disorders have symptoms that are better explained by asd itself or are hard to distinguish from asd s symptoms epilepsy with variations in risk of epilepsy due to age cognitive level and type of language disorder several metabolic defects such as phenylketonuria are associated with autistic symptoms minor physical anomalies are significantly increased in the autistic population preempted diagnoses although the dsm iv rules out the concurrent diagnosis of many other conditions along with autism the full criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd tourette syndrome and other of these conditions are often present and these co occurrent conditions are increasingly accepted sleep problems affect about two thirds of individuals with asd at some point in childhood these most commonly include symptoms of insomnia such as difficulty in falling asleep frequent nocturnal awakenings and early morning awakenings sleep problems are associated with difficult behaviors and family stress and are often a focus of clinical attention over and above the primary asd diagnosis history upright zero eight portrait of victor of aveyron a feral child caught in one seven nine eight who displayed possible symptoms of autism a few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named the table talk of martin luther compiled by his notetaker mathesius contains the story of a one two year old boy who may have been severely autistic the earliest well documented case of autism is that of hugh blair of borgue as detailed in a one seven four seven court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul blair s marriage to gain blair s inheritance the wild boy of aveyron a feral child caught in one seven nine eight showed several signs of autism the medical student jean itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation the new latin word autismus english translation autism was coined by the swiss psychiatrist eugen bleuler in one nine one zero as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia he derived it from the greek word aut s meaning self and used it to mean morbid self admiration referring to autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance a soviet child psychiatrist grunya sukhareva described a similar syndrome that was published in russian in one nine two five and in german in one nine two six clinical development and diagnoses upright alt balding man in his early six zero s in coat and tie with a serious but slightly smiling expression leo kanner introduced the label early infantile autism in one nine four three the word autism first took its modern sense in one nine three eight when hans asperger of the vienna university hospital adopted bleuler s terminology autistic psychopaths in a lecture in german about child psychology asperger was investigating an asd now known as asperger syndrome though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until one nine eight one leo kanner of the johns hopkins hospital first used autism in its modern sense in english when he introduced the label early infantile autism in a one nine four three report of one one children with striking behavioral similarities almost all the characteristics described in kanner s first paper on the subject notably autistic aloneness and insistence on sameness are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders it is not known whether kanner derived the term independently of asperger kanner s reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia and child psychiatry s focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant s response to refrigerator mothers starting in the late one nine six zero s autism was established as a separate syndrome terminology and distinction from schizophrenia as late as the mid one nine seven zero s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism while in two zero zero seven it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood asd have affected how asd is viewed parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their child s autistic behavior is perceived negatively and many primary care physicians and medical specialists express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research it took until one nine eight zero for the dsm iii to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia in one nine eight seven the dsm iii r provided a checklist for diagnosing autism in may two zero one three the dsm five was released updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders the grouping of disorders including pdd nos autism asperger syndrome rett syndrome and cdd has been removed and replaced with the general term of autism spectrum disorders the two categories that exist are impaired social communication and or interaction and restricted and or repetitive behaviors the internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find difficult to deal with and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely societal and cultural aspects of autism have developed some in the community seek a cure while others believe that autism is simply another way of being society and culture an autistic culture has emerged accompanied by the autistic rights and neurodiversity movements events include world autism awareness day autism sunday autistic pride day autreat and others social science scholars study those with autism in hopes to learn more about autism as a culture transcultural comparisons and research on social movements many autistic individuals have been successful in their fields autism rights movement the autism rights movement is a social movement within the context of disability rights that emphasizes the concept of neurodiversity viewing the autism spectrum as a result of natural variations in the human brain rather than a disorder to be cured the autism rights movement advocates for including greater acceptance of autistic behaviors therapies that focus on coping skills rather than on imitating the behaviors of those without autism and the recognition of the autistic community as a minority group autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the human genome this perspective is distinct from fringe theories that autism is caused by environmental factors such as vaccines a common criticism against autistic activists is that the majority of them are high functioning or have asperger syndrome and do not represent the views of low functioning autistic people employment about half of autistic people are unemployed and one third of those with graduate degrees may be unemployed among those who find work most are employed in sheltered settings working for wages below the national minimum while employers state hiring concerns about productivity and supervision experienced employers of autistic people give positive reports of above average memory and detail orientation as well as a high regard for rules and procedure in autistic employees a majority of the economic burden of autism is caused by decreased earnings in the job market some studies also find decreased earning among parents who care for autistic children references external links icd nine omim two zero nine eight five zero medlineplus zero zero one five two six emedicinesubj med

measure of the diffuse reflection of solar radiation out of the total solar radiation and measured on a scale from zero corresponding to a black body that absorbs all incident radiation to one corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation surface albedo is defined as the ratio of radiosity j e to the irradiance e e flux per unit area received by a surface the proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the earth s surface these factors vary with atmospheric composition geographic location and time see position of the sun while bi hemispherical reflectance is calculated for a single angle of incidence i e for a given position of the sun albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period the temporal resolution may range from seconds as obtained from flux measurements to daily monthly or annual averages unless given for a specific wavelength spectral albedo albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation due to measurement constraints it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface between zero three and three m this spectrum includes visible light zero four zero seven m which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark e g trees absorb most radiation whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright e g snow reflects most radiation albedo is an important concept in climatology astronomy and environmental management e g as part of the leadership in energy and environmental design leed program for sustainable rating of buildings the average albedo of the earth from the upper atmosphere its planetary albedo is three zero three five because of cloud cover but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features the term albedo was introduced into optics by johann heinrich lambert in his one seven six zero work photometria terrestrial albedo any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about zero nine for fresh snow to about zero zero four for charcoal one of the darkest substances deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body when seen from a distance the ocean surface has a low albedo as do most forests whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms most land areas are in an albedo range of zero one to zero four the average albedo of earth is about zero three this is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds upright one two two zero zero three two zero zero four mean annual clear sky and total sky albedo earth s surface albedo is regularly estimated via earth observation satellite sensors such as nasa s modis instruments on board the terra and aqua satellites and the ceres instrument on the suomi npp and jpss as the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite not all directions a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional hemispherical reflectance and bi hemispherical reflectance e g these calculations are based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function brdf which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle bdrf can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo earth s average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about if earth were frozen entirely and hence be more reflective the average temperature of the planet would drop below if only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about in contrast if the entire earth was covered by water a so called ocean planet the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost in two zero two one scientists reported that earth dimmed by zero five over two decades one nine nine eight two zero one seven as measured by earthshine using modern photometric techniques this may have both been co caused by climate change as well as a substantial increase in global warming however the link to climate change has not been explored to date and it is unclear whether or not this represents an ongoing trend white sky black sky and blue sky albedo for land surfaces it has been shown that the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle i can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms the directional hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle sometimes referred to as black sky albedo and the bi hemispherical reflectance bar sometimes referred to as white sky albedo with being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle and being the proportion of diffuse illumination the actual albedo also called blue sky albedo can then be given as one d bar alpha theta i d bar this formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface examples of terrestrial albedo effects illumination albedo is not directly dependent on illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light except in circumstances where a change in illumination induces a change in the earth s surface at that location e g through melting of reflective ice that said albedo and illumination both vary by latitude albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics with a local maximum in the tropics insolation effects the intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation solar irradiance high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation whereas areas such as the sahara desert which also have a relatively high albedo will be hotter due to high insolation tropical and sub tropical rainforest areas have low albedo and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts which have lower insolation because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb effectively cooling the earth this has been a concern since arctic ice and snow has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker being water or ground which is darker color and reflects less heat back into space this feedback loop results in a reduced albedo effect climate and weather albedo affects climate by determining how much radiation a planet absorbs the uneven heating of earth from albedo variations between land ice or ocean surfaces can drive weather albedo temperature feedback when an area s albedo changes due to snowfall a snow temperature feedback results a layer of snowfall increases local albedo reflecting away sunlight leading to local cooling in principle if no outside temperature change affects this area e g a warm air mass the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall deepening the snow temperature feedback however because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight higher insolation cause melting when the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo such as grass soil or ocean the effect is reversed the darkening surface lowers albedo increasing local temperatures which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further resulting in still more heating snow snow albedo is highly variable ranging from as high as zero nine for freshly fallen snow to about zero four for melting snow and as low as zero two for dirty snow over antarctica snow albedo averages a little more than zero eight if a marginally snow covered area warms snow tends to melt lowering the albedo and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack the ice albedo positive feedback just as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow the albedo of snow covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow when sea ice melts either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above the snow covered surface is reduced and more surface of sea water is exposed so the rate of energy absorption increases the extra absorbed energy heats the sea water which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts as with the preceding example of snowmelt the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important for global warming cryoconite powdery windblown dust containing soot sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets the dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates because of this in order to reduce the error of energy estimates it is important to measure the albedo of snow covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions small scale effects albedo works on a smaller scale too in sunlight dark clothes absorb more heat and light coloured clothes reflect it better thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing solar photovoltaic effects albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic devices for example the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon a si h and crystalline silicon c si based compared to traditional spectral integrated albedo predictions research showed impacts of over one zero more recently the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of two two commonly occurring surface materials both human made and natural and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies industrial solar farms commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched roof applications trees because forests generally have a low albedo the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation in the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through evapotranspiration the water vapor causes cooling on the land surface causes heating where it condenses acts a strong greenhouse gas and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate in seasonally snow covered zones winter albedos of treeless areas are one zero to five zero higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily deciduous trees have an albedo value of about zero one five to zero one eight whereas coniferous trees have a value of about zero zero nine to zero one five variation in summer albedo across both forest types is associated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high growth capacity display a greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper canopy the result is that wavelengths of light not used in photosynthesis are more likely to be reflected back to space rather than being absorbed by other surfaces lower in the canopy studies by the hadley centre have investigated the relative generally warming effect of albedo change and cooling effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool new forests in high latitudes e g siberia were neutral or perhaps warming water upright one three reflectivity of smooth water at refractive index one three three three water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials the reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the fresnel equations at the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner not diffusely the glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this at small angles of incident light waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity vs incident angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of earth near the terminator early morning late afternoon and near the poles however as mentioned above waviness causes an appreciable reduction because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light note that white caps on waves look white and have high albedo because the water is foamed up so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect adding up their reflectivities fresh black ice exhibits fresnel reflection snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to zero nine clouds cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near zero to a maximum approaching zero eight on any given day about half of earth is covered by clouds which reflect more sunlight than land and water clouds keep earth cool by reflecting sunlight but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic a study following the burning of the kuwaiti oil fields during iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies aerosol effects aerosols very fine particles droplets in the atmosphere have both direct and indirect effects on earth s radiative balance the direct albedo effect is generally to cool the planet the indirect effect the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties is less certain as per spracklen et al the effects are aerosol direct effect aerosols directly scatter and absorb radiation the scattering of radiation causes atmospheric cooling whereas absorption can cause atmospheric warming aerosol indirect effect aerosols modify the properties of clouds through a subset of the aerosol population called cloud condensation nuclei increased nuclei concentrations lead to increased cloud droplet number concentrations which in turn leads to increased cloud albedo increased light scattering and radiative cooling first indirect effect but also leads to reduced precipitation efficiency and increased lifetime of the cloud second indirect effect in extremely polluted cities like delhi aerosol pollutants influence local weather and induce an urban cool island effect during the day black carbon another albedo related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles the size of this effect is difficult to quantify the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is zero two w m two with a range zero one to zero four w m two black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo james hansen the efficacy of this forcing is two i e for a given forcing it is twice as effective as co two in altering global surface air temperature compare zender testimony supra note seven at four figure three see j hansen the efficacy for changes of arctic sea ice albedo is three in additional runs not shown here we found that the efficacy of albedo changes in antarctica is also three see also flanner m g c s zender j t randerson and p j rasch present day climate forcing and response from black carbon in snow one one two j geophys res d one one two zero two two zero zero seven the forcing is maximum coincidentally with snowmelt onset triggering strong snow albedo feedback in local springtime consequently the efficacy of black carbon snow forcing is more than three times greater than forcing by co two human activities human activities e g deforestation farming and urbanization change the albedo of various areas around the globe however quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult further study is required to determine anthropogenic effects albedo in astronomy in astronomy the term albedo can be defined in several different ways depending upon the application and the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation involved optical or visual albedo the albedos of planets satellites and minor planets such as asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties the study of albedos their dependence on wavelength lighting angle phase angle and variation in time composes a major part of the astronomical field of photometry for small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos for example the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids enceladus a moon of saturn has one of the highest known optical albedos of any body in the solar system with an albedo of zero nine nine another notable high albedo body is eris with an albedo of zero nine six many small objects in the outer solar system and asteroid belt have low albedos down to about zero zero five a typical comet nucleus has an albedo of zero zero four such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily space weathered surface containing some organic compounds the overall albedo of the moon is measured to be around zero one four but it is strongly directional and non lambertian displaying also a strong opposition effect although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless solar system bodies two common optical albedos that are used in astronomy are the v band geometric albedo measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer and the bond albedo measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected their values can differ significantly which is a common source of confusion in detailed studies the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five hapke parameters which semi empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces one of these five parameters is yet another type of albedo called the single scattering albedo it is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles it depends on properties of the material refractive index the size of the particle and the wavelength of the incoming radiation an important relationship between an object s astronomical geometric albedo absolute magnitude and diameter is given by a left frac right two where a is the astronomical albedo d is the diameter in kilometers and h is the absolute magnitude radar albedo in planetary radar astronomy a microwave or radar pulse is transmitted toward a planetary target e g moon asteroid etc and the echo from the target is measured in most instances the transmitted pulse is circularly polarized and the received pulse is measured in the same sense of polarization as the transmitted pulse sc and the opposite sense oc the echo power is measured in terms of radar cross section or total power sc oc and is equal to the cross sectional area of a metallic sphere perfect reflector at the same distance as the target that would return the same echo power those components of the received echo that return from first surface reflections as from a smooth or mirror like surface are dominated by the oc component as there is a reversal in polarization upon reflection if the surface is rough at the wavelength scale or there is significant penetration into the regolith there will be a significant sc component in the echo caused by multiple scattering for most objects in the solar system the oc echo dominates and the most commonly reported radar albedo parameter is the normalized oc radar albedo often shortened to radar albedo hat left frac right where the denominator is the effective cross sectional area of the target object with mean radius r a smooth metallic sphere would have hat one radar albedos of solar system objects moon zero zero six mercury zero zero five venus zero one

it especially fonts intended to be read by children and is also found in italic type in the english grammar a and its variant an are indefinite articles history the earliest certain ancestor of a is aleph also written aleph the first letter of the phoenician alphabet which consisted entirely of consonants for that reason it is also called an abjad to distinguish it from a true alphabet in turn the ancestor of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in proto sinaitic script influenced by egyptian hieroglyphs styled as a triangular head with two horns extended when the ancient greeks adopted the alphabet they had no use for a letter to represent the glottal stop the consonant sound that the letter denoted in phoenician and other semitic languages and that was the first phoneme of the phoenician pronunciation of the letter so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel and called it by the similar name of alpha in the earliest greek inscriptions after the greek dark ages dating to the eight th century bc the letter rests upon its side but in the greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg or by the angle at which the cross line is set the etruscans brought the greek alphabet to their civilization in the italian peninsula and left the letter unchanged the romans later adopted the etruscan alphabet to write the latin language and the resulting letter was preserved in the latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages including english typographic variants different glyphs of the lowercase letter a during roman times there were many variant forms of the letter a first was the monumental or lapidary style which was used when inscribing on stone or other permanent media there was also a cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing which was done on more perishable surfaces due to the perishable nature of these surfaces there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive such as majuscule cursive minuscule cursive and semicursive minuscule variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles the known variants include the early semi uncial the uncial and the later semi uncial none upright typographic variants include a double storey a and single storey at the end of the roman empire five th century ad several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through western europe among these were the semicursive minuscule of italy the merovingian script in france the visigothic script in spain and the insular or anglo irish semi uncial or anglo saxon majuscule of great britain by the nine th century the caroline script which was very similar to the present day form was the principal form used in book making before the advent of the printing press this form was derived through a combining of prior forms road sign in ireland showing the irish latin alpha form of a in lower and upper case forms one five th century italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today these variants the italic and roman forms were derived from the caroline script version the italic form also called script a is used in most current handwriting it consists of a circle and vertical stroke on the right this slowly developed from the fifth century form resembling the greek letter tau in the hands of medieval irish and english writers the roman form is used in most printed material it consists of a small loop with an arc over it a both derive from the majuscule capital form in greek handwriting it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop as demonstrated by the uncial version shown many fonts then made the right leg vertical in some of these the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc resulting in the printed form while in others it was dropped resulting in the modern handwritten form graphic designers refer to the italic and roman forms as single decker a and double decker a respectively italic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest set in roman type there are some other cases aside from italic type where script a also called latin alpha is used in contrast with latin a such as in the international phonetic alphabet use in writing systems pronunciation of the name of the letter in european languages

is often used to denote a variable with various conventional meanings in different areas of mathematics moreover in one six three seven ren descartes invented the convention of representing unknowns

some scholars suggest the word comes from the choctaw meaning plants or weeds and meaning to cut to trim or to gather the meaning may have been clearers of the thicket or herb gatherers referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants the state has numerous place names of native american origin however there are no correspondingly similar words in the alabama language an

involved in the american civil war although comparatively few battles were fought in the state alabama contributed about one two zero zero zero zero soldiers to the war effort union army troops occupying courthouse square in huntsville following its capture and occupation by federal forces in one eight six four a company of cavalry soldiers from huntsville alabama joined nathan bedford forrest s battalion in hopkinsville kentucky the company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves collar and coattails this led to them being greeted with yellowhammer and the name later was applied to all alabama troops in the confederate army alabama s slaves were freed by the one three th amendment in one eight six five alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in may one eight six five until its official restoration to the union in one eight six eight from one eight six seven to one eight seven four with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised many african americans emerged as political leaders in the state alabama was represented in congress during this period by three african american congressmen jeremiah haralson benjamin s turner and james t rapier following the war the state remained chiefly agricultural with an economy tied to cotton during reconstruction state legislators ratified a new state constitution in one eight six eight which created the state s first public school system and expanded women s rights legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation organized insurgent resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and republicans besides the short lived original ku klux klan these included the pale faces knights of the white camellia red shirts and the white league reconstruction in alabama ended in one eight seven four when the democrats regained control of the legislature and governor s office through an election dominated by fraud and violence they wrote another constitution in one eight seven five and the legislature passed the blaine amendment prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious affiliated schools the same year legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools railroad passenger cars were segregated in one eight nine one two zero th century the developing skyline of birmingham in one nine one five the new one nine zero one constitution of alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population including nearly all african americans and native americans and tens of thousands of poor european americans through making voter registration difficult requiring a poll tax and literacy test the one nine zero one constitution required racial segregation of public schools by one nine zero three only two nine eight zero african americans were registered in alabama although at least seven four zero zero zero were literate this compared to more than one eight one zero zero zero african americans eligible to vote in one nine zero zero the numbers dropped even more in later decades the state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the one nine five zero s jails were segregated in one nine one one hospitals in one nine one five toilets hotels and restaurants in one nine two eight and bus stop waiting rooms in one nine four five while the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax by one nine four one whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws six zero zero zero zero zero whites vs five two zero zero zero zero african americans nearly all blacks had lost the ability to vote despite numerous legal challenges which succeeded in overturning certain provisions the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement the exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in one nine six five to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens the rural dominated alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised african americans but it did not relieve them of paying taxes partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for african americans in the south the rosenwald fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as rosenwald schools in alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with rosenwald funds which paid one third of the construction costs the fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest black residents effectively taxed themselves twice by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools which were built in many rural areas they often donated land and labor as well the former mount sinai school in rural autauga county completed in one nine one nine it was one of the three eight seven rosenwald schools built in the state beginning in one nine one three the first eight zero rosenwald schools were built in alabama for african american children a total of three eight seven schools seven teachers houses and several vocational buildings were completed by one nine three seven in the state several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the national register of historic places continued racial discrimination and lynchings agricultural depression and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of african americans from rural alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the two zero th century as part of the great migration out of the south reflecting this emigration the population growth rate in alabama see historical populations table below dropped by nearly half from one nine one zero to one nine two zero at the same time many rural people migrated to the city of birmingham to work in new industrial jobs birmingham experienced such rapid growth it was called the magic city by one nine two zero birmingham was the three six th largest city in the united states heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy its residents were under represented for decades in the state legislature which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes as it was required by the state constitution this did not change until the late one nine six zero s following a lawsuit and court order the alabama legislature also intentionally diluted the effect of the black vote by instituting numbered place requirements for local elections industrial development related to the demands of world war ii brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living one example of this massive influx of workers occurred in mobile between one nine four zero and one nine four three more than eight nine zero zero zero people moved into the city to work for war related industries cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base despite massive population changes in the state from one nine zero one to one nine six one the rural dominated legislature refused to reapportion house and senate seats based on population as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses they held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas one result was that jefferson county containing birmingham s industrial and economic powerhouse contributed more than one third of all tax revenue to the state but did not receive a proportional amount in services urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature a one nine six zero study noted that because of rural domination a minority of about two five of the total state population is in majority control of the alabama legislature in the united states supreme court cases of baker v carr one nine six two and reynolds v sims one nine six four the court ruled that the principle of one man one vote needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties in one nine seven two for the first time since one nine zero one the legislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census this benefited the urban areas that had developed as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than sixty years other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts african americans continued to press in the one nine five zero s and one nine six zero s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement including legal challenges in one nine five four the u s supreme court ruled in brown v board of education that public schools had to be desegregated but alabama was slow to comply during the one nine six zero s under governor george wallace alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation the civil rights movement had notable events in alabama including the montgomery bus boycott one nine five five one nine five six freedom rides in one nine six one and one nine six five selma to montgomery marches these contributed to congressional passage and enactment of the civil rights act of one nine six four and voting rights act of one nine six five by the u s congress legal segregation ended in the states in one nine six four but jim crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court according to the new york times by two zero one seven many of alabama s african americans were living in alabama s cities such as birmingham and montgomery also the black belt region across central alabama is home to largely poor counties that are predominantly african american these counties include dallas lowndes marengo and perry alabama has made some changes since the late two zero th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation in the one nine eight zero s an omnibus redistricting case dillard v crenshaw county challenged the at large voting for representative seats of one eight zero alabama jurisdictions including counties and school boards at large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county as the majority tended to take all seats despite african americans making up a significant minority in the state they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at large jurisdictions as part of settlement of this case five alabama cities and counties including chilton county adopted a system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi seat jurisdictions this has resulted in more proportional representation for voters in another form of proportional representation two three jurisdictions use limited voting as in conecuh county in one nine eight two limited voting was first tested in conecuh county together use of these systems has increased the number of african americans and women being elected to local offices resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens beginning in the one nine six zero s the state s economy shifted away from its traditional lumber steel and textile industries because of increased foreign competition steel jobs for instance declined from four six three one four in one nine five zero to one four one eight five in two zero one one however the state particularly huntsville benefited from the opening of the george c marshall space flight center in one nine six zero a major facility in the development of the saturn rocket program and the space shuttle technology and manufacturing industries such as automobile assembly replaced some the state s older industries in the late twentieth century but the state s economy and growth lagged behind other states in the area such as georgia and florida two one st century in two zero zero one alabama supreme court chief justice roy moore installed a statue of the ten commandments in the

was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems at that time alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts this had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas for instance birmingham and jefferson county taxes had supplied one third of the state

madison montgomery shelby and tuscaloosa in the state have limited home rule instead most counties in the state must lobby the local legislation committee of the state legislature to get simple local

v carr one nine six four required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population and redistricted after each census to implement the principle of one man one vote before that each county was represented by one state senator leading to under representation in the state senate for more urbanized populous counties the rural bias of the state legislature which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house affected politics well into the two zero th century failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas the lack of home rule for counties in

relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law from one nine zero one through the one nine six zero s the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas as counties were the basis of election districts the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three quarters of the century until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in one nine seven two to meet equal representation alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the one nine five zero s and one nine six zero s during the civil rights movement when whites bureaucratically and at times violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform governor george wallace the state s only four term governor was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation only after passage of the federal civil rights act of one nine six four and

trojan war in greek mythology achilles or achilleus was a hero of the trojan war the greatest of all the greek warriors and is the central character of homer s iliad he was the son of the nereid thetis and peleus king of phthia achilles most notable feat during the trojan war was the slaying of the trojan prince hector outside the gates of troy although the death of achilles is not presented in the iliad other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the trojan war by paris who shot him with an arrow later legends beginning with statius unfinished epic achilleid written in the one st century ad state that achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for one heel because when his mother thetis dipped him in the river styx as an infant she held him by one of his heels alluding to these legends the term achilles heel has come to mean a point of weakness especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution the achilles tendon is also named after him due to these legends etymology linear b tablets attest to the personal name achilleus in the forms a ki re u and a ki re we the latter being the dative of the former the name grew more popular even becoming common soon after the seventh century bc and was also turned into the female form achille a attested in attica in the fourth century bc ig ii one six one seven and in the form achillia on a stele in halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting an amazon achilles name can be analyzed as a combination of distress pain sorrow grief and people soldiers nation resulting in a proto form akh l u os he who has the people distressed or he whose people have distress the grief or distress of the people is a theme raised numerous times in the iliad and frequently by achilles himself achilles role as the hero of grief or distress forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of him as the hero of glory usually in war furthermore la s has been construed by gregory nagy following leonard palmer to mean a corps of soldiers a muster with this derivation the name obtains a double meaning in the poem when the hero is functioning rightly his men bring distress to the enemy but when wrongly his men get the grief of war the poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership the education of achilles by eug ne delacroix pastel on paper c one eight six two getty center los angeles another etymology relates the name to a proto indo european compound h e p ds sharp foot which first gave an illyrian k pedi s evolving through time into khpde s and then akhidde s the shift from dd to ll is then ascribed to the passing of the name into greek via a pre greek source the first root part h e sharp pointed also gave greek ak point silence healing akm point edge zenith and ox s sharp pointed keen quick clever whereas stems from the root h eg to be upset afraid the whole expression would be comparable to the latin acupedius swift of foot compare also the latin word family of aci s sharp edge or point battle line battle engagement acus needle pin bodkin and acu to make pointed sharpen whet to exercise to arouse whence acute some topical epitheta of achilles in the iliad point to this swift footedness namely pod rk s d os achille s swift footed divine achilles or even more frequently p das k s achille s quick footed achilles some researchers deem the name a loan word possibly from a pre greek language achilles descent from the nereid thetis and a similarity of his name with those of river deities such as acheron and achelous have led to speculations about his being an old water divinity see below worship robert s p beekes has suggested a pre greek origin of the name based among other things on the coexistence of and in epic language which may account for a palatalized phoneme ly in the original language birth and early years thetis dipping the infant achilles into the river styx by peter paul rubens c one six two five museum boijmans van beuningen rotterdam achilles was the son of the thetis a nereid and peleus the king of the myrmidons zeus and poseidon had been rivals for thetis s hand in marriage until prometheus the fore thinker warned zeus of a prophecy originally uttered by themis goddess of divine law that thetis would bear a son greater than his father for this reason the two gods withdrew their pursuit and had her wed peleus there is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events in the argonautica four seven six zero zeus sister and wife hera alludes to thetis chaste resistance to the advances of zeus pointing out that thetis was so loyal to hera s marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods thetis although a daughter of the sea god nereus was also brought up by hera further explaining her resistance to the advances of zeus zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal chiron teaching achilles how to play the lyre roman fresco from herculaneum one st century ad according to the achilleid written by statius in the one st century ad and to non surviving previous sources when achilles was born thetis tried to make

the heel in the later vase paintings presenting the death of achilles the arrow or in many cases arrows hit his torso peleus entrusted achilles to chiron the centaur who lived on mount pelion to be reared thetis foretold that her son s fate was either to gain glory and die young or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity achilles chose the former and decided to take part in the trojan war according to homer achilles grew up in phthia with his companion patroclus according to photius the sixth book of the new history by ptolemy hephaestion reported that thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by peleus when she had achilles peleus noticed tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot and confided him to the centaur chiron later chiron exhumed the body of the damysus who was the fastest of all the giants removed the ankle and incorporated it into achilles burnt foot other names among the appellations under which achilles is generally known are the

into revealing himself some post homeric sources claim that in order to keep achilles safe from the war thetis or in some versions peleus hid the young man at the court of lycomedes king of skyros there achilles was disguised as a girl and lived among lycomedes daughters perhaps under the name pyrrha the red haired girl cercysera or aissa swift with lycomedes daughter deidamia whom in the account of statius he raped achilles there fathered two sons neoptolemus also called pyrrhus after his father s possible alias and oneiros according to this story odysseus learned from the prophet calchas that the achaeans would be unable to capture troy without achilles aid odysseus went to skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women s clothes and jewellery and placed a shield and spear among his goods when achilles instantly took up the spear odysseus saw through his disguise and convinced him to join the greek campaign in another version of the story odysseus arranged for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with lycomedes women while the women fled in panic achilles prepared to defend the court thus giving his identity away in the trojan war achilles and agamemnon from a

achilles gave telephus a wound that would not heal telephus consulted an oracle who stated that he that wounded shall heal guided by the oracle he arrived at argos where achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to troy according to other reports in euripides lost play about telephus he went to aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked achilles to heal his wound achilles refused claiming to have no medical knowledge alternatively telephus held orestes for ransom the ransom being achilles aid in healing the wound odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound therefore the spear must be able to heal it pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and telephus was healed troilus achilles slaying troilus red figure kylix signed by euphronios according to the cypria the part of the epic cycle that tells the events of the trojan war before achilles wrath when the achaeans desired to return home they were restrained by achilles who afterwards attacked the cattle of aeneas sacked neighbouring cities like pedasus and lyrnessus where the greeks capture the queen briseis and killed tenes a son of apollo as well as priam s son troilus in the sanctuary of apollo thymbraios however the romance between troilus and chryseis described in geoffrey chaucer s troilus and criseyde and in william shakespeare s troilus and cressida is a medieval invention in dares phrygius account of the destruction of troy the latin summary through which the story of achilles was transmitted to medieval europe as well as in older accounts troilus was a young trojan prince the youngest of king priam s and hecuba s five legitimate sons or according other sources another son of apollo despite his youth he was one of the main trojan war leaders a horse fighter or chariot fighter according to homer prophecies linked troilus fate to that of troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him yet achilles struck by the beauty of both troilus and his sister polyxena and overcome with lust directed his sexual attentions on the youth who refusing to yield instead found himself decapitated upon an altar omphalos of apollo thymbraios later versions of the story suggested troilus was accidentally killed by achilles in an over ardent lovers embrace in this version of the myth achilles death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege ancient writers treated troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents had troilus lived to adulthood the first vatican mythographer claimed troy would have been invincible however the motif is older and found already in plautus bacchides in the iliad achilles cedes briseis to agamemnon from the house of the tragic poet in pompeii fresco one st century ad naples national archaeological museum homer s iliad is the most famous narrative of achilles deeds in the trojan war achilles wrath m nis achill s is the central theme of the poem the first two lines of the iliad read the homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the decade long war and does not narrate achilles death it begins with achilles withdrawal from battle after being dishonoured by agamemnon the commander of the achaean forces agamemnon has taken a woman named chryseis as his slave her father chryses a priest of apollo begs agamemnon to return her to him agamemnon refuses and apollo sends a plague amongst the greeks the prophet calchas correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless achilles vows to protect him achilles does so and calchas declares that chryseis must be returned to her father agamemnon consents but then commands that achilles battle prize briseis the daughter of briseus be brought to him to replace chryseis angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away and as he says later because he loves briseis with the urging of his mother thetis achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other greek forces at the same time burning with rage over agamemnon s theft achilles prays to thetis to convince zeus to help the trojans gain ground in the war so that he may regain his honour as the battle turns against the greeks thanks to the influence of zeus nestor declares that the trojans are winning because agamemnon has angered achilles and urges the king to appease the warrior agamemnon agrees and sends odysseus and two other chieftains ajax and phoenix they promise that if achilles returns to battle agamemnon will return the captive briseis and other gifts achilles rejects all agamemnon offers him and simply urges the greeks to sail home as he was planning to do the rage of achilles fresco by giovanni battista tiepolo one seven five seven villa valmarana ai nani vicenza the trojans led by hector

achilles armour though achilles remains at his camp patroclus succeeds in pushing the trojans back from the beaches but is killed by hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of troy after receiving the news of the death of patroclus from antilochus the son of nestor achilles grieves over his beloved companion s death his mother thetis comes to comfort the distraught achilles she persuades hephaestus to make new armour for him in place of the armour that patroclus had been wearing which was taken by hector the new armour includes the shield of achilles described in great detail in the poem enraged over the death of patroclus achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out hector achilles even engages in battle with the river god scamander who has become angry that achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed the god tries to drown achilles but is stopped by hera and hephaestus zeus himself takes note of achilles rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction seeming to show that the unhindered rage of achilles can defy fate itself finally achilles finds his prey achilles chases hector around the wall of troy three times before athena in the form of hector s favorite and dearest brother deiphobus persuades hector to stop running and fight achilles face to face after hector realizes the trick he knows the battle is inevitable wanting to go down fighting he charges at achilles with his only weapon his sword but misses accepting his fate hector begs achilles not to spare his life but to treat his body with respect after killing him achilles tells hector it is hopeless to expect that of him declaring that my rage my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw such agonies you have caused me achilles then kills hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot after having a dream where patroclus begs achilles to hold his funeral achilles hosts a series of funeral games in honour of his companion at the onset of his duel with hector achilles is

defeat achilles after his temporary truce with priam achilles fights and kills the warrior queen only to grieve over her death later at first he was so distracted by her beauty he did not fight as intensely as usual once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life he refocused and killed her following the death of patroclus nestor s son antilochus becomes achilles closest companion when memnon son of the dawn goddess eos and king of ethiopia slays antilochus achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield killing memnon consequently eos will not let the sun rise until zeus persuades her the fight between achilles and memnon over antilochus echoes that of achilles and hector over patroclus except that memnon unlike hector was also the son of a goddess many homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the iliad s description of the death of patroclus and achilles reaction to it the episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic aethiopis which was composed after the iliad possibly in the seven th century bc the aethiopis is now lost except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors achilles tending patroclus wounded by an arrow attic red figure kylix c five zero zero bc altes museum berlin achilles and patroclus the exact nature of achilles relationship with patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times in the iliad it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship homer does not suggest that achilles and his close friend patroclus had sexual relations although there is no direct evidence in the text of the iliad that achilles and patroclus were lovers this theory was expressed by some later authors commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures in five th century bce athens the intense bond was often viewed in light of the greek custom of paiderasteia in plato s symposium the participants in a dialogue about love assume that achilles and patroclus were a couple phaedrus argues that achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and patroclus was the lover however ancient greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women many pairs of men throughout history have been compared to achilles and patroclus to imply a homosexual relationship death dying achilles achilleas thniskon in the gardens of the achilleion the death of achilles even if considered solely as it occurred in the oldest sources is a complex one with many different versions in the oldest version the iliad and as predicted by hector with his dying breath the hero s death was brought about by paris with an arrow to the heel according to statius in some versions the god apollo guided paris arrow some retellings also state that achilles was scaling the gates of troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow all of these versions deny paris any sort of valour owing to the common conception that paris was a coward and not the man his brother hector was and achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield ajax carries off the body of achilles attic black figure lekythos from sicily c five one zero bc staatliche antikensammlungen munich after death achilles bones were mingled with those of patroclus and funeral games were held he was represented in the aethiopis as living after his death in the island of leuke at the mouth of the river danube another version of achilles death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the trojan princesses polyxena achilles asks priam for polyxena s hand in marriage priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world s greatest warrior but while priam is overseeing the private marriage of polyxena and achilles paris who would have to give up helen if achilles married his sister hides in the bushes and shoots achilles with a divine arrow killing him in the odyssey agamemnon informs achilles of his pompous burial and the erection of his mound at the hellespont while they are receiving the dead suitors in hades he claims they built a massive burial mound on the beach of ilion that could be seen by anyone approaching from the ocean achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of patroclus paris was later killed by philoctetes using the enormous bow of heracles in book one one of homer s odyssey odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades one of these is achilles who when greeted as blessed in life blessed in death responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead but achilles then asks odysseus of his son s exploits in the trojan war and when odysseus tells of neoptolemus heroic actions achilles is filled with satisfaction this leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how achilles felt about the heroic life according to some accounts he had married medea in life so that after both their deaths they were united in the elysian fields of hades as hera promised thetis in apollonius argonautica three rd century bc fate of achilles armour oinochoe ca five two zero bc ajax and odysseus fighting over the armour of achilles achilles armour was the object of a feud between odysseus and telamonian ajax ajax the greater they competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after achilles to their trojan prisoners who after considering both men s presentations decided odysseus was more deserving of the armour furious ajax cursed odysseus which earned him the ire of athena who temporarily made ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep thinking them his comrades after a while when athena lifted his madness and ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep he was so ashamed that he committed suicide odysseus eventually gave the armour to neoptolemus the son of achilles when odysseus encounters the shade of ajax much later in the house of hades odyssey one one five four three five six six ajax is still so angry about the outcome of the competition that he refuses to speak to odysseus a relic claimed to be achilles bronze headed spear was preserved for centuries in the temple of athena on the acropolis of phaselis lycia a port on the pamphylian gulf the city was visited in three three three bce by alexander the great who envisioned himself as the new achilles and carried the iliad with him but his court biographers do not mention the spear however it was shown in the time of pausanias in the two nd century ce achilles ajax and a game of petteia numerous paintings on pottery have suggested a tale not mentioned in the literary traditions at some point in the war achilles and ajax were playing a board game petteia they were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle the trojans attacked and reached the heroes who were saved only by an intervention of athena worship and heroic cult sacrifice of polyxena and tumulus shaped tomb of achilles with a tripod in front on the polyxena sarcophagus circa five zero zero bc roman statue of a man with the dead body of a boy identified as achilles and troilus two nd century ad naples national archaeological museum the tomb of achilles extant throughout antiquity in troad was venerated by thessalians but also by persian expeditionary forces as well as by alexander the great and the roman emperor caracalla achilles cult was also to be found at other places e g on the island of astypalaea in the sporades in sparta which had a sanctuary in elis and in achilles homeland thessaly as well as in the magna graecia cities of tarentum locri and croton accounting for an almost panhellenic cult to the hero the cult of achilles is illustrated in the five zero zero bce polyxena sarcophagus which depicts the sacrifice of polyxena near the tumulus of achilles strabo one three one three two also suggested that such a cult of achilles existed in troad the spread and intensity of the hero s veneration among the greeks that had settled on the northern coast of the pontus euxinus today s black sea appears to have been remarkable an archaic cult is attested for the milesian colony of olbia as well as for an island in the middle of the black sea today identified with snake island ukrainian zmiinyi near kiliya ukraine early dedicatory inscriptions from the greek colonies on the black sea graffiti and inscribed clay disks these possibly being votive offerings from olbia the area of berezan island and the tauric chersonese attest the existence of a heroic cult of achilles from the sixth century bc onwards the cult was still thriving in the third century ce when dedicatory stelae from olbia refer to an achilles pont rch s roughly lord of the sea or of the pontus euxinus who was invoked as a protector of the city of olbia venerated on par with olympian gods such as the local apollo prostates hermes agoraeus or poseidon pliny the elder two three seven nine ad in his natural history mentions a port of the ach i and an island of achilles famous for the tomb of that man situated somewhat nearby olbia and the dnieper bug estuary furthermore at one two five roman miles from this island he places a peninsula which stretches forth in the shape of a sword obliquely called dromos achilleos achill s dr mos the race course of achilles and considered the place of the hero s exercise or of games instituted by him this last feature of pliny s account is considered to be the iconic spit called today tendra or kosa tendra and kosa djarilgatch situated between the mouth of the dnieper and karkinit bay but which is hardly one two five roman miles c one eight five km away from the dnieper bug estuary as pliny states to the race course he gives a length of eight zero miles c one two zero km whereas the spit measures c seven zero km today in the following chapter of his book pliny refers to the same island as achillea and introduces two further names for it leuce or macaron from greek island of the blest the present day measures he gives at this point seem to account for an identification of achillea or leuce with today s snake island pliny s contemporary pomponius mela c four three ad tells that achilles was buried on an island named achillea situated between the borysthenes and the ister adding to the geographical confusion ruins of a square temple measuring three zero meters to a side possibly that dedicated to achilles were discovered by captain kritzikly in one eight two three on snake island a second exploration in one eight four zero showed that the construction of a lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple a fifth century bc black glazed lekythos inscription found on the island in one eight four zero reads glaukos son of poseidon dedicated me to achilles lord of leuke in another inscription from the fifth or fourth century bc a statue is dedicated to achilles lord of leuke by a citizen of olbia while in a further dedication the city of olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the island s cult again suggesting its quality as a place of a supra regional hero veneration the heroic cult dedicated to achilles on leuce seems to go back to an account from the lost epic aethiopis according to which after his untimely death thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical le k n sos white island already in the fifth century bc pindar had mentioned a cult of achilles on a bright island phaenn n sos of the black sea while in another of his works pindar would retell the story of the immortalized achilles living on a geographically indefinite island of the blest together with other heroes such as his father peleus and cadmus well known is the connection of these mythological fortunate isles mak r n n soi or the homeric elysium with the stream oceanus which according to greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the euxine with it guy hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by alcaeus speaking of achilles lord of scythia and the opposition of north and south as evoked by achilles fight against the aethiopian prince memnon who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother eos after his death the periplus of the euxine sea c one three zero ad gives the following details the greek geographer dionysius periegetes who likely lived during the first century ce wrote that the island was called leuce because the wild animals which live there are white it is said that there in leuce island reside the souls of achilles and other heroes and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island this is how jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour similarly others relate the island s name to its white cliffs snakes or birds dwelling there pausanias has been told that the island is covered with forests and full of animals some wild some tame in this island there is also achilles temple and his statue leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing pausanias reports that the delphic pythia sent a lord of croton to be cured of a chest wound ammianus marcellinus attributes the healing to waters aquae on the island a number of important commercial port cities of the greek waters were dedicated to achilles herodotus pliny the elder and strabo reported on the existence of a town ach lleion built by settlers from mytilene in the sixth century bc close to the hero s presumed burial mound in the troad later attestations point to an ach lleion in messenia according to stephanus byzantinus and an ach lleios in laconia nicolae densu ianu recognized a connection to achilles in the names of aquileia and of the northern arm of the danube delta called chilia presumably from an older achileii though his conclusion that leuce had sovereign rights over the black sea evokes modern rather than archaic sea law the kings of epirus claimed to be descended from achilles through his son neoptolemus alexander the great son of the epirote princess olympias could therefore also claim this descent and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor he is said to have visited the tomb of achilles at achilleion while passing troy in ad two one six the roman emperor caracalla while on his way to war against parthia emulated alexander by holding games around achilles tumulus reception during antiquity in greek tragedy the greek tragedian aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about achilles given the title achilleis by modern scholars the tragedies relate the deeds of achilles during the trojan war including his defeat of hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by paris and guided by apollo punctures his heel extant fragments of the achilleis and other aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play the first part of the achilleis trilogy the myrmidons focused on the relationship between achilles and chorus who represent the achaean army and try to convince achilles to give up his quarrel with agamemnon only a few lines survive today in plato s symposium phaedrus points out that aeschylus portrayed achilles as the lover and patroclus as the beloved phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because achilles being the younger and more beautiful of the two was the beloved who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to avenge him the tragedian sophocles also wrote the lovers of achilles a play with achilles as the main character only a few fragments survive towards the end of the five th century bce a more negative view of achilles emerges in greek drama euripides refers to achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in hecuba electra and iphigenia in aulis in greek philosophy zeno the philosopher zeno of elea centred one of his paradoxes on an imaginary footrace between swift footed achilles and a tortoise by which he attempted to show that achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start and therefore that motion and change were impossible as a student of the monist parmenides and a member of the eleatic school zeno believed time and motion to be illusions plato in hippias minor a dialogue attributed to plato an arrogant man named hippias argues with socrates the two get into a discussion about lying they decide that a person who is intentionally false must be better than a person who is unintentionally false on the basis that someone who lies intentionally must understand the subject about which they are lying socrates uses various analogies discussing athletics and the sciences to prove his point the two also reference homer extensively socrates and hippias agree that odysseus who concocted a number of lies throughout the odyssey and other stories in the trojan war cycle was false intentionally achilles like odysseus told numerous falsehoods hippias believes that achilles was a generally honest man while socrates believes that achilles lied for his own benefit the two argue over whether it is better to lie on purpose or by accident socrates eventually abandons homeric arguments and makes sports analogies to drive home the point someone who does wrong on purpose is a better person than someone who does wrong unintentionally in roman and medieval literature the romans who traditionally traced their lineage to troy took a highly negative view of achilles virgil refers to achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men while horace portrays achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children other writers such as catullus propertius and ovid represent a second strand of disparagement with an emphasis on achilles erotic career this strand continues in latin accounts of the trojan war by writers such as dictys cretensis and dares phrygius and in beno t de sainte maure s roman de troie and guido delle colonne s historia destructionis troiae which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the matter of troy until the one seven th century achilles was described by the byzantine chronicler leo the deacon not as hellene but as scythian while according to the byzantine author john malalas his army was made up of a

lincoln s law partner william h herndon would grow irritated when lincoln would bring his children to the law office their father it seemed was often too absorbed in his work to notice his children s behavior herndon recounted i have felt many and many a time that i wanted to wring their little necks and yet out of respect for lincoln i kept my mouth shut lincoln did not note what his children were doing or had done the deaths of their sons eddie and willie had profound effects on both parents lincoln suffered from melancholy a condition now thought to be clinical depression later in life

his voracious reading and decided to become a lawyer rather than studying in the office of an established attorney as was the custom lincoln borrowed legal texts from attorneys john todd stuart and thomas drummond purchased books including blackstone s commentaries and chitty s pleadings and read law on his own he later said of his legal education that i studied with nobody illinois state legislature one eight three four one eight four two lincoln s home in springfield illinois lincoln s second state house campaign in one eight three four this time as a whig was a success over a powerful whig opponent then followed his four terms in the illinois house of representatives for sangamon county he championed construction of the illinois and michigan canal and later was a canal commissioner he voted to expand suffrage beyond white landowners to all white males but adopted a free soil stance opposing both slavery and abolition in one eight three seven he declared the

american colonization society which advocated a program of abolition in conjunction with settling freed slaves in liberia he was admitted to the illinois bar in one eight three six and moved to springfield and began to practice law under john t stuart mary todd s cousin lincoln emerged as a formidable trial combatant during cross examinations and closing arguments he partnered several years

john j hardin though he prevailed with the party in limiting hardin to one term lincoln not only pulled off his strategy of gaining the nomination in one eight four six but also won the election he was the only whig in the illinois delegation but as dutiful as any participated in almost all votes and made speeches that toed the party line he was assigned to the committee on post office and post roads and the committee on expenditures in the war department lincoln teamed with joshua r giddings on a bill to abolish slavery in the district of columbia with compensation for the owners enforcement to capture fugitive slaves and a popular vote on the matter he dropped the bill when it eluded whig support political views on foreign and military policy lincoln spoke against the mexican american war which he imputed to president james k polk s desire for military glory that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood he supported the wilmot proviso a failed proposal to ban slavery in any u s territory won from mexico lincoln emphasized his opposition to polk by drafting and introducing his spot resolutions the war had begun with a mexican slaughter of american soldiers in territory disputed by mexico and polk insisted that mexican soldiers had invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow citizens on our own soil lincoln demanded that polk show congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on american soil the resolution was ignored in both congress and the national papers and it cost lincoln political support in his district one illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him spotty lincoln lincoln later regretted some of his statements especially his attack on presidential war making powers lincoln had pledged in one eight four six to serve only one term in the house realizing clay was unlikely to win the presidency he supported general zachary taylor for the whig nomination in the one eight four eight presidential election taylor won and lincoln hoped in vain to be appointed commissioner of the general land office the administration offered to appoint him secretary or governor of the oregon territory as consolation this distant territory was a democratic stronghold and acceptance of the post would have disrupted his legal and political career in illinois so he declined and resumed his law practice prairie lawyer upright lincoln in one eight five seven in his springfield practice lincoln handled every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer twice a year he appeared for one zero consecutive weeks in county seats in the midstate county courts this continued for one six years lincoln handled transportation cases in the midst of the nation s western expansion

bridge company against a riverboat company in hurd v rock island bridge company a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge in one eight four nine he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water the idea was never commercialized but it made lincoln the only president to hold a patent lincoln appeared before the illinois supreme court in one seven five cases he was sole counsel in five one cases of which three one were decided in his favor from one eight five three to one eight six zero one of his largest clients was the illinois central railroad his legal reputation gave rise to the nickname honest abe lincoln argued in an one eight five eight criminal trial defending william duff armstrong who was on trial for the murder of james preston metzker the case is famous for lincoln s use of a fact established by judicial notice to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness after an opposing witness testified to seeing the crime in the moonlight lincoln produced a farmers almanac showing the moon was at a low angle drastically reducing visibility armstrong was acquitted leading up to his presidential campaign lincoln elevated his profile in an one eight five nine murder case with his defense of simeon quinn peachy harrison who was a third cousin harrison was also the grandson of lincoln s political opponent rev peter cartwright harrison was charged with the murder of greek crafton who as he lay dying of his wounds confessed to cartwright that he had provoked harrison lincoln angrily protested the judge s initial decision to exclude cartwright s testimony about the confession as inadmissible hearsay lincoln argued that the testimony involved a dying declaration and was not subject to the hearsay rule instead of holding lincoln in contempt of court as expected the judge a democrat reversed his ruling and admitted the testimony into evidence resulting in harrison s acquittal republican politics one eight five four one eight six zero emergence as republican leader upright lincoln in one eight five eight the year of his debates with stephen douglas over slavery the debate over the status of slavery in the territories failed to alleviate tensions between the slave holding south and the free north with the failure of the compromise of one eight five zero a legislative package designed to address the issue in his one eight five two eulogy for clay lincoln highlighted the latter s support for gradual emancipation and opposition to both extremes on the slavery issue as the slavery debate in the nebraska and kansas territories became particularly acrimonious illinois senator stephen a douglas proposed popular sovereignty as a compromise the measure would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery the legislation alarmed many northerners who sought to prevent the resulting spread of slavery but douglas s kansas nebraska act narrowly passed congress in may one eight five four lincoln did not comment on the act until months later in his peoria speech in october one eight five four lincoln then declared his opposition to slavery which he repeated en route to the presidency he said the kansas act had a declared indifference but as i must think a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery i cannot but hate it i hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself i hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world lincoln s attacks on the kansas nebraska act marked his return to political life nationally the whigs were irreparably split by the kansas nebraska act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue reflecting on the demise of his party lincoln wrote in one eight five five i think i am a whig but others say there are no whigs and that i am an abolitionist i do no more than oppose the extension of slavery the new republican party was formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery drawing from the antislavery wing of the whig party and combining free soil liberty and antislavery democratic party members lincoln resisted early republican entreaties fearing that the new party would become a platform for extreme abolitionists lincoln held out hope for rejuvenating the whigs though he lamented his party s growing closeness with the nativist know nothing movement in one eight five four lincoln was elected to the illinois legislature but declined to take his seat the year s elections showed the strong opposition to the kansas nebraska act and in the aftermath lincoln sought election to the united states senate at that time senators were elected by the state legislature after leading in the first six rounds of voting he was unable to obtain a majority lincoln instructed his backers to vote for lyman trumbull trumbull was an antislavery democrat and had received few votes in the earlier ballots his supporters also antislavery democrats had vowed not to support any whig lincoln s decision to withdraw enabled his whig supporters and trumbull s antislavery democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream democratic candidate joel aldrich matteson one eight five six campaign violent political confrontations in kansas continued and opposition to the kansas nebraska act remained strong throughout the north as the one eight five six elections approached lincoln joined the republicans and attended the bloomington convention which formally established the illinois republican party the convention platform endorsed congress s right to regulate slavery in the territories and backed the admission of kansas as a free state lincoln gave the final speech of the convention supporting the party platform and called for the preservation of the union at the june one eight five six republican national convention though lincoln received support to run as vice president john c fr mont and william dayton comprised the ticket which lincoln supported throughout illinois the democrats nominated former secretary of state james buchanan and the know nothings nominated former whig president millard fillmore buchanan prevailed while republican william henry bissell won election as governor of illinois and lincoln became a leading republican in illinois alt painting a portrait of dred scott petitioner in dred scott v sandford dred scott v sandford dred scott was a slave whose master took him from a slave state to a free territory under the missouri compromise after scott was returned to the slave state he petitioned a federal court for his freedom his petition was denied in dred scott v sandford one eight five seven supreme court chief justice roger b taney in the decision wrote that blacks were not citizens and derived no rights from the constitution while many democrats hoped that dred scott would end the dispute over slavery in the territories the decision sparked further outrage in the north lincoln denounced it as the product of a conspiracy of democrats to support the slave power he argued the decision was at variance with the declaration of independence he said that while the founding fathers did not believe all men equal in every respect they believed all men were equal in certain inalienable rights among which are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness lincoln douglas debates and cooper union speech in one eight five eight douglas was up for re election in the u s senate and lincoln hoped to defeat him many in the party felt that a former whig should be nominated in one eight five eight and lincoln s one eight five six campaigning and support of trumbull had earned him a favor some eastern republicans supported douglas from his opposition to the lecompton constitution and admission of kansas as a slave state many illinois republicans resented this eastern interference for the first time illinois republicans held a convention to agree upon a senate candidate and lincoln won the nomination with little opposition abraham lincoln one eight six zero by mathew brady taken the day of the cooper union speech lincoln accepted the nomination with great enthusiasm and zeal after his nomination he delivered his house divided speech with the biblical reference mark three two five a house divided against itself cannot stand i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free i do not expect the union to be dissolved i do not expect the house to fall but i do expect it will cease to be divided it will become all one thing or all the other the speech created a stark image of the danger of disunion the stage was then set for the election of the illinois legislature which would in turn select lincoln or douglas when informed of lincoln s nomination douglas stated lincoln is the strong man of the party and if i beat him my victory will be hardly won the senate campaign featured seven debates between lincoln and douglas these were the most famous political debates in american history they had an atmosphere akin to a prizefight and drew crowds in the thousands the principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically lincoln warned that douglas slave power was threatening the values of republicanism and accused douglas of distorting the founding fathers premise that all men are created equal douglas emphasized his freeport doctrine that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery and accused lincoln of having joined the abolitionists lincoln s argument assumed a moral tone as he claimed douglas represented a conspiracy to promote slavery douglas s argument was more legal claiming that lincoln was defying the authority of the u s supreme court in the dred scott decision though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes the democrats won more seats and the legislature re elected douglas lincoln s articulation of the issues gave him a national political presence in may one eight five nine lincoln purchased the illinois staats anzeiger a german language newspaper that was consistently supportive most of the state s one three zero zero zero zero german americans voted democratically but the german language paper mobilized republican support in the aftermath of the one eight five eight election newspapers frequently mentioned lincoln as a potential republican presidential candidate rivaled by william h seward salmon p chase edward bates and simon cameron while lincoln was popular in the midwest he lacked support in the northeast and was unsure whether to seek office in january one eight six zero lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the nomination if offered and in the following months several local papers endorsed his candidacy over the coming months lincoln was tireless making nearly fifty speeches along the campaign trail by the quality and simplicity of his rhetoric he quickly became the champion of the republican party however despite his overwhelming support in the midwestern united states he was less appreciated in the east horace greeley editor of the new york tribune at that time wrote up an unflattering account of lincoln s compromising position on slavery and his reluctance to challenge the court s dred scott ruling which was promptly used against him by his political rivals on february two seven one eight six zero powerful new york republicans invited lincoln to give a speech at cooper union in which he argued that the founding fathers of the united states had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery he insisted that morality required opposition to slavery and rejected any groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong many in the audience thought he appeared awkward and even ugly but lincoln demonstrated intellectual leadership that brought him into contention journalist noah brooks reported no man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a new york audience historian david herbert donald described the speech as a superb political move for an unannounced candidate to appear in one rival s seward own state at an event sponsored by the second rival s chase loyalists while not mentioning either by name during its delivery in response to an inquiry about his ambitions lincoln said the taste is in my

black hair and gray eyes michael martinez wrote about the effective imaging of lincoln by his campaign at times he was presented as the plain talking rail splitter and at other times he was honest abe unpolished but trustworthy on may one eight at the republican national convention in chicago lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot beating candidates such as seward and chase a former democrat hannibal hamlin of maine was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket lincoln s success depended on his campaign team his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue and his strong support for internal improvements and the tariff pennsylvania put him over the top led by the state s iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support lincoln s managers had focused on this delegation while honoring lincoln s dictate to make no contracts that will bind me as the slave power tightened its grip on the national government most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party throughout the one eight five zero s lincoln had doubted the prospects of civil war and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession when douglas was selected as the candidate of the northern democrats delegates from eleven slave states walked out of the democratic convention they opposed douglas s position on popular sovereignty and selected incumbent vice president john c breckinridge as their candidate a group of former whigs and know nothings formed the constitutional union party and nominated john bell of tennessee lincoln and douglas competed for votes in the north while bell and breckinridge primarily found support in the south prior to the republican convention the lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization the wide awakes which it used to generate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties people of the northern states knew the southern states would vote against lincoln and rallied supporters for lincoln as douglas and the other candidates campaigned lincoln gave no speeches relying on the enthusiasm of the republican party the party did the leg work that produced majorities across the north and produced an abundance of campaign posters leaflets and newspaper editorials republican speakers focused first on the party platform and second on lincoln s life story emphasizing his childhood poverty the goal was to demonstrate the power of free labor which allowed a common farm boy to work his way to the top by his own efforts the republican party s production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition a chicago tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed lincoln s life and sold one zero zero zero zero zero two zero zero zero zero zero copies though he did not give public appearances many sought to visit him and write him in the runup to the

will suffer death before i consent to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right lincoln tacitly supported the corwin amendment to the constitution which passed congress and was awaiting ratification by the states when lincoln took office that doomed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed a few weeks before the war lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the constitution alt a large crowd in

to an invasion william tecumseh sherman talked to lincoln during inauguration week and was sadly disappointed at his failure to realize that the country was sleeping on a volcano and that the south was preparing for war donald concludes that his repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on ft sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood but he also vowed not to surrender the forts the only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot they did just that on april one five lincoln called on the states to send a total of seven five zero zero zero volunteer troops to recapture forts protect washington and preserve the union which in his view remained intact despite the seceding states this call forced states to choose sides virginia seceded and was rewarded with the designation of richmond as the confederate capital despite its exposure to union lines north

criticized lincoln for refusing to compromise on slavery the radical republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery on august six one eight six one lincoln signed the

victory twice a week lincoln met with his cabinet in the afternoon occasionally mary prevailed on him to take a carriage ride concerned that he was working too hard for his edification lincoln relied upon a book by his chief of staff general henry halleck entitled elements of military art and science halleck was a disciple of the european strategist antoine henri jomini lincoln began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points such as the mississippi river lincoln saw the importance of vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy s army rather than simply capturing territory general mcclellan after the union rout at bull run and winfield scott s retirement lincoln appointed major general george b mcclellan general in chief mcclellan then took months to

mcclellan for the general s continued inaction he elevated henry halleck in july and appointed john pope as head of the new army of virginia pope satisfied lincoln s desire to advance on richmond from the north thus protecting washington from counterattack but pope was then soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of one eight six two forcing the army of the potomac back to defend washington despite his dissatisfaction with mcclellan s failure to reinforce pope lincoln restored him to command of all forces around washington two days after mcclellan s return to command general robert e lee s forces crossed the potomac river into maryland leading to the battle of antietam that battle a union victory was among the bloodiest in american history it facilitated lincoln s emancipation proclamation in january mcclellan then resisted the president s demand that he pursue lee s withdrawing army while general don carlos buell likewise refused orders to move the army of the ohio against rebel forces in eastern tennessee lincoln replaced buell with william rosecrans and after the one eight six two midterm elections he replaced mcclellan with ambrose burnside the appointments were both politically neutral and adroit on lincoln s part burnside against presidential advice launched an offensive across the rappahannock river and was defeated by lee at fredericksburg in december desertions during one eight six three came in the thousands and only increased after fredericksburg so lincoln replaced burnside with joseph hooker in the one eight six two midterm elections the republicans suffered severe losses due to rising inflation high taxes rumors of corruption suspension of habeas corpus military draft law and fears that freed slaves would come north and undermine the labor market the emancipation proclamation gained votes for republicans in rural new england and the upper midwest but cost votes in the irish and german strongholds and in the lower midwest where many southerners had lived for generations in the spring of one eight six three lincoln was sufficiently optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to think the end of the war could be near the plans included attacks by hooker on lee north of richmond rosecrans on chattanooga grant on vicksburg and a naval assault on charleston hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville in may then resigned and was replaced by george meade meade followed lee north into pennsylvania and beat him in the gettysburg campaign but then failed to follow up despite lincoln s

which lasted for two days lincoln is largely responsible for the thanksgiving holiday thanksgiving had become a regional holiday in new england in the one seven th century it had been sporadically proclaimed by the federal government on irregular dates the prior proclamation had been during james madison s presidency five zero years earlier in one eight six three lincoln declared the final

area now known as yosemite national park judicial appointments upright salmon portland chase was lincoln s chief justice alt seated man supreme court appointments lincoln s philosophy on court nominations was that we cannot ask a man what he will do and if we should and he should answer us we should despise him for it therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known lincoln made five appointments to the supreme court noah haynes swayne was an anti slavery lawyer who was committed to the union samuel freeman miller supported lincoln in the one eight six zero election and was an avowed abolitionist david davis was lincoln s campaign manager in one eight six zero and had served as a judge in the illinois court circuit where lincoln practiced democrat stephen johnson field a previous california supreme court justice provided geographic and political balance finally lincoln s treasury secretary salmon p chase became chief justice lincoln believed chase was an able jurist would support reconstruction legislation and that his appointment united the republican party other judicial appointments lincoln appointed two seven judges to the united states district courts but no

after being attended by doctor charles leale and two other doctors lincoln was taken across the street to petersen house after remaining in a coma for eight hours lincoln died at seven two two in the

dismissed the charge funeral and burial funeral of lincoln the late president lay in state first in the east room of the white house and then in the capitol rotunda from april one nine through april two one the caskets containing lincoln s body and the body of his son willie traveled for three weeks on the lincoln special funeral train the train followed a circuitous route from washington d c to springfield illinois stopping at many cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands many others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with bands bonfires and hymn singing or in silent grief poet walt whitman composed when lilacs last in the dooryard bloom d to eulogize him one of four poems he wrote about lincoln african americans were especially moved they had lost their moses in a larger sense the reaction was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war historians emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow but noted that some lincoln haters celebrated his death lincoln s body was buried at oak ridge cemetery in springfield and now lies within the lincoln tomb religious and philosophical beliefs upright alt lincoln sitting with his hand on his chin and his elbow on his leg abraham lincoln painting by george peter alexander healy in one eight six nine as a young man lincoln was a religious skeptic he was deeply familiar with the bible quoting and praising it he was private about his position on organized religion and respected the beliefs of others he never made a clear profession of christian beliefs through his entire public career lincoln had a proneness for quoting scripture his three most famous speeches the house divided speech the gettysburg address and his second inaugural each contain direct allusions to providence and quotes from scripture in the one eight four zero s lincoln subscribed to the doctrine of necessity a belief that the human mind was controlled by a higher power with the death of his son edward in one eight five zero he more frequently expressed a dependence on god he never joined a church although he frequently attended first presbyterian church with his wife beginning in one eight five two in the one eight five zero s lincoln asserted his belief in providence in a general way and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals he regarded the republicanism of the founding fathers with an almost religious reverence the death of son willie in february one eight six two may have caused him to look toward religion for solace after willie s death he questioned the divine necessity of the war s severity he wrote at this time that god could have either saved or destroyed the union without a human contest yet the contest began and having begun he could give the final victory to either side any day yet the contest proceeds lincoln did believe in an all powerful god that shaped events and by one eight six five was expressing those beliefs in major speeches by the end of the war he increasingly appealed to the almighty for solace and to explain events writing on april four one eight six four to a newspaper editor in kentucky i claim not to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me now at the end of three years struggle the nation s condition is not what either party or any man devised or expected god alone can claim it whither it is tending seems plain if god now wills the removal of a great wrong and wills also that we of the north as well as you of the south shall pay fairly for our complicity in that wrong impartial history will find therein new cause to attest and revere the justice and goodness of god this spirituality can best be seen in his second inaugural address considered by some scholars as the greatest such address in american history and by lincoln himself as his own greatest speech or one of them at the very least lincoln explains therein the cause purpose and result of the war was god s will later in life lincoln s frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs and might have been a device to reach his audiences who were mostly evangelical protestants on the day lincoln was assassinated he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the holy land health upright alt an older tired looking abraham lincoln with a beard lincoln in february one eight six five two months before his death lincoln is believed to have had depression smallpox and malaria he took blue mass pills which contained mercury to treat constipation it is unknown to what extent he may have suffered from mercury poisoning several claims have been made that lincoln s health was declining before the assassination these are often based on photographs of lincoln appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting it is also suspected that he might have had a rare genetic disease such as marfan syndrome or multiple endocrine neoplasia type two b legacy republican values lincoln s redefinition of republican values has been stressed by historians such as john patrick diggins harry v jaffa vernon burton eric foner and herman j belz lincoln called the declaration of independence which emphasized freedom and equality for all the sheet anchor of republicanism beginning in the one eight five zero s he did this at a time when the constitution which tolerated slavery was the focus of most political discourse diggins notes lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself in the one eight six zero cooper union speech instead of focusing on the legality of an argument he focused on the moral basis of republicanism his position on war was founded on a legal argument regarding the constitution as essentially a contract among the states and all parties must agree to pull out of the contract furthermore it was a national duty to ensure the republic stands in every state many soldiers and religious leaders from the north though felt the fight for liberty and freedom of slaves was ordained by their moral and religious beliefs as a whig activist lincoln was a spokesman for business interests favoring high tariffs banks infrastructure improvements and railroads in opposition to jacksonian democrats william c harris found that lincoln s reverence for the founding fathers the constitution the laws under it and the preservation of the republic and its institutions strengthened his conservatism james g randall emphasizes his tolerance and moderation in his preference for orderly progress his distrust of dangerous agitation and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform randall concludes that he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so called radicalism which involved abuse of the south hatred for the slaveholder thirst for vengeance partisan plotting and ungenerous demands that southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders reunification of the states in lincoln s first inaugural address he explored the nature of democracy he denounced secession as anarchy and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints he said a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments is the only true sovereign of a free people the successful reunification of the states had consequences for how people viewed the country the term the united states has historically been used sometimes in the plural these united states and other times in the singular the civil war was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the one nine th century historical reputation sign frederick douglass in surveys of u s scholars ranking presidents conducted since one nine four eight the top three presidents are lincoln washington and franklin delano roosevelt although the order varies between one nine nine nine and two zero one one lincoln john f kennedy and ronald reagan have been the top ranked presidents in eight surveys according to gallup a two zero zero four study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked lincoln number one while legal scholars placed him second after george washington upright one two five alt an aerial photo a large white building with big pillars lincoln memorial in washington d c lincoln s assassination left him a national martyr he was viewed by abolitionists as a champion of human liberty republicans linked lincoln s name to their party many though not all in the south considered lincoln as a man of outstanding ability historians have said he was a classical liberal in the one nine th century sense allen c guelzo states that lincoln was a classical liberal democrat an enemy of artificial hierarchy a friend to trade and business as ennobling and enabling and an american counterpart to mill cobden and bright whose portrait lincoln hung in his white house office schwartz argues that lincoln s american reputation grew slowly from the late one nine th century until the progressive era one nine zero zero one nine two zero s when he emerged as one of america s most venerated heroes even among white southerners the high point came in one nine two two with the dedication of the lincoln memorial on the national mall in washington d c union nationalism as envisioned by lincoln helped lead america to the nationalism of theodore roosevelt woodrow wilson and franklin delano roosevelt in the new deal era liberals honored lincoln not so much as the self made man or the great war president but as the advocate of the common man who they claimed would have supported the welfare state the lincoln cent an american coin portraying lincoln sociologist barry schwartz argues that in the one nine three zero s and one nine four zero s the memory of abraham lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with a moral symbol inspiring and guiding american life during the great depression he argues lincoln served as a means for seeing the world s disappointments for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful franklin d roosevelt preparing america for war used the words of the civil war president to clarify the threat posed by germany and japan americans asked what would lincoln do however schwartz also finds that since world war ii lincoln s symbolic power has lost relevance and this fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness he suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept in the cold war years lincoln s image shifted to a symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes by the late one nine six zero s some african american intellectuals led by lerone bennett jr rejected lincoln s role as the great emancipator bennett won wide attention when he called lincoln a white supremacist in one nine six eight he noted that lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks bennett argued that lincoln opposed social equality and proposed sending freed slaves to another country defenders such as authors dirck and cashin retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day and that he was a moral visionary who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause as fast as politically possible the emphasis shifted away from lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation by the one nine seven zero s lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives apart from neo confederates such as mel bradford who denounced his treatment of the white south for his intense nationalism support for business his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage his acting in terms of lockean and burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition and his devotion to the principles of the founding fathers lincoln became a favorite exemplar for liberal intellectuals across the world historian barry schwartz wrote in two zero zero nine that lincoln s image suffered erosion fading prestige benign ridicule in the late two zero th century on the other hand donald opined in his one nine nine six biography that lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability defined by the poet john keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts and not compelled toward fact or reason in the two one st century president barack obama named lincoln his favorite president and insisted on using the lincoln bible for his inaugural ceremonies lincoln has often been portrayed by hollywood almost always in a flattering light memory and memorials lincoln s portrait appears on two denominations of united

classical period in ancient greece taught by plato he was the founder of the lyceum the peripatetic school of philosophy and the aristotelian tradition his writings cover many subjects including physics biology zoology metaphysics logic ethics aesthetics poetry theatre music rhetoric psychology linguistics economics politics meteorology geology and government aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him it was above all from his teachings that the west inherited its intellectual lexicon as well as problems and methods of inquiry as a result his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the west and it continues to be a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion little is known about his life aristotle was born in the city of stagira in northern greece his father nicomachus died when aristotle was a child and he was brought up by a guardian at seventeen or eighteen years of age he joined plato s academy in athens and remained there until the age of thirty seven c three four seven bc shortly after plato died aristotle left athens and at the request of philip ii of macedon tutored alexander the great beginning in three four three bc he established a library in the lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls though aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication only around a third of his original output has survived none of it intended for publication aristotle s views profoundly shaped medieval scholarship the influence of physical science extended from late antiquity and the early middle ages into the renaissance and were not replaced systematically until the enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics were developed some of aristotle s zoological observations found in his biology such as on the hectocotyl reproductive arm of the octopus were disbelieved until the one nine th century he also influenced judeo islamic philosophies eight zero zero one four zero zero during the middle ages as well as christian theology especially the neoplatonism of the early church and the scholastic tradition of the catholic church aristotle was revered among medieval muslim scholars as the first teacher and among medieval christians like thomas aquinas as simply the philosopher while the poet dante called him the master of those who know his works contain the earliest known formal study of logic and were studied by medieval scholars such as peter abelard and john buridan aristotle s influence on logic continued well into the one nine th century in addition his ethics though always influential gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics aristotle has been

established the biographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points covers ancient biographies of aristotle aristotle whose name means the best purpose in ancient greek was born in three eight four bc in stagira chalcidice about five five km three four miles east of modern day thessaloniki his father nicomachus was the personal physician to king amyntas of macedon while he was young aristotle learned about biology and medical information which was taught by his father both of aristotle s parents died when he was about thirteen and proxenus of atarneus became his guardian although little information about aristotle s childhood has survived he probably spent some time within the macedonian palace making his first connections with the macedonian monarchy at the age of seventeen or eighteen aristotle moved to athens to continue his education at plato s academy he probably experienced the eleusinian mysteries as he wrote when describing the sights one viewed at the eleusinian mysteries to experience is to learn aristotle remained in athens for nearly twenty years before leaving in three four eight four seven bc the traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the academy s direction after control passed to plato s nephew speusippus although it is possible that he feared the anti macedonian sentiments in athens at that time and left before plato died aristotle then accompanied xenocrates to the court of his friend hermias of atarneus in asia minor after the death of hermias aristotle travelled with his pupil theophrastus to the island of lesbos where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon while in lesbos aristotle married pythias either hermias s adoptive daughter or niece she bore him a daughter whom they also named pythias in three four three bc aristotle was invited by philip ii of macedon to become the tutor to his son alexander thumb upright portrait bust of aristotle an imperial roman one st or two nd century ad copy of a lost bronze sculpture made by lysippos aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of macedon during aristotle s time in the macedonian court he gave lessons not only to alexander but also to two other future kings ptolemy and cassander aristotle encouraged alexander toward eastern conquest and aristotle s own attitude towards persia was unabashedly ethnocentric in one famous example he counsels alexander to be a leader to the greeks and a despot to the barbarians to look after the former as after friends and relatives and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants by three three five bc aristotle had returned to athens establishing his own school there known as the lyceum aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years while in athens his wife pythias died and aristotle became involved with herpyllis of stagira who bore him a son whom he named after his father nicomachus if the suda an uncritical compilation from the middle ages is accurate he may also have had an er menos palaephatus of abydus this period in athens between three three five and three two three bc is when aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works he wrote many dialogues of which only fragments have survived those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not for the most part intended for widespread publication they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students his most important treatises include physics metaphysics nicomachean ethics politics on the soul and poetics aristotle studied and made significant contributions to logic metaphysics mathematics physics biology botany ethics politics agriculture medicine dance and theatre near the end of his life alexander and aristotle became estranged over alexander s relationship with persia and persians a widespread tradition in antiquity suspected aristotle of playing a role in alexander s death but the only evidence of this is an unlikely claim made some six years after the death following alexander s death anti macedonian sentiment in athens was rekindled in three two two bc demophilus and eurymedon the hierophant reportedly denounced aristotle for impiety prompting him to flee to his mother s family estate in chalcis on euboea at which occasion he was said to have stated i will not allow the athenians to sin twice against philosophy a reference to athens s trial and execution of socrates he died on euboea of natural causes later that same year having named his student antipater as his chief executor and leaving a will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife speculative philosophy logic with the prior analytics aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic and his conception of it was the dominant form of western logic until one nine th century advances in mathematical logic kant stated in the critique of pure reason that with aristotle logic reached its completion organon in words in terms in equations all men are mortal all greeks are men all greeks are mortal m a ps a ms a p file modus barbara equations svg what is today called aristotelian logic with its types of syllogism methods of logical argument aristotle himself would have labelled analytics the term logic he reserved to mean dialectics most of aristotle s work is probably not in its original form because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers the logical works of aristotle were compiled into a set of six books called the organon around four zero bc by andronicus of rhodes or others among his followers the books are categories on interpretation prior analytics posterior analytics topics on sophistical refutations thumb upright plato left and aristotle in raphael s one five zero nine fresco the school of athens aristotle holds his nicomachean ethics and gestures to the earth representing his view in immanent realism whilst plato gestures to the heavens indicating his theory of forms and holds his timaeus the order of the books or the teachings from which they are composed is not certain but this list was derived from analysis of aristotle s writings it goes from the basics the analysis of simple terms in the categories the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in on interpretation to the study of more complex forms namely syllogisms in the analytics and dialectics in the topics and sophistical refutations the first three treatises form the core of the logical theory stricto sensu the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning the rhetoric is not conventionally included but it states that it relies on the topics metaphysics the word metaphysics appears to have been coined by the first century ad editor who assembled various small selections of aristotle s works to the treatise we know by the name metaphysics aristotle called it first philosophy and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science physics as the contemplative theoretik philosophy which is theological and studies the divine he wrote in his metaphysics one zero two six a one six substance aristotle examines the concepts of substance ousia and essence to ti n einai the what it was to be in his metaphysics book vii and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form a philosophical theory called hylomorphism in book viii he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum or the stuff of which it is composed for example the matter of a house is the bricks stones timbers etc or whatever constitutes the potential house while the form of the substance is the actual house namely covering for bodies and chattels or any other differentia that let us define something as a house the formula that gives the components is the account of the matter and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form immanent realism thumb upright one five plato s forms exist as universals like the ideal form of an apple for aristotle both matter and form belong to the individual thing hylomorphism like his teacher plato aristotle s philosophy aims at the universal aristotle s ontology places the universal katholou in particulars kath hekaston things in the world whereas for plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate for aristotle form is still what phenomena are based on but is instantiated in a particular substance plato argued that all things have a universal form which could be either a property or a relation to other things when one looks at an apple for example one sees an apple and one can also analyse a form of an apple in this distinction there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple moreover one can place an apple next to a book so that one can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things for example it is possible that there is no particular good in existence but good is still a proper universal form aristotle disagreed with plato on this point arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things in addition aristotle disagreed with plato about the location of universals where plato spoke of the world of forms a place where all universal forms subsist aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated so according to aristotle the form of apple exists within each apple rather than in the world of the forms potentiality and actuality with regard to the change kinesis and its causes now as he defines in his physics and on generation and corruption three one nine b three two zero a he distinguishes the coming to be from growth and diminution which is change in quantity locomotion which is change in space and alteration which is change in quality thumb aristotle argued that a capability like playing the flute could be acquired the potential made actual by learning the coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property in that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality dynamis and actuality entelecheia in association with the matter and the form referring to potentiality this is what a thing is capable of doing or being acted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else for example the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially dynamei a plant and if it is not prevented by something it will become a plant potentially beings can either act poiein or be acted upon paschein which can be either innate or learned for example the eyes possess the potentiality of sight innate being acted upon while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning exercise acting actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality because the end telos is the principle of every change and for the sake of the end exists potentiality therefore actuality is the end referring then to the previous example it can be said that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do in summary the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities which is also a final cause or end then aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula in time and in substantiality with this definition of the particular substance i e matter and form aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings for example what is it that makes a man one since according to plato there are two ideas animal and biped how then is man a unity however according to aristotle the potential being matter and the actual one form are one and the same epistemology aristotle s immanent realism means his epistemology is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world and rises to knowledge of the universal whereas for plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal forms or ideas and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these aristotle uses induction from examples alongside deduction whereas plato relies on deduction from a priori principles natural philosophy aristotle s natural philosophy spans a wide range of natural phenomena including those now covered by physics biology and other natural sciences in aristotle s terminology natural philosophy is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics biology and other natural sciences aristotle s work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning which he also would describe as science however his use of the term science carries a different meaning than that covered by the term scientific method for aristotle all science dianoia is either practical poetical or theoretical metaphysics one zero two five b two five his practical science includes ethics and politics his poetical science means the study of fine arts including poetry his theoretical science covers physics mathematics and metaphysics physics thumb the four classical elements fire air water earth of empedocles and aristotle illustrated with a burning log the log releases all four elements as it is destroyed five elements in his on generation and corruption aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by empedocles earth water air and fire to two of the four sensible qualities hot cold wet and dry in the empedoclean scheme all matter was made of the four elements in differing proportions aristotle s scheme added the heavenly aether the divine substance of the heavenly spheres stars and planets motion aristotle describes two kinds of motion violent or unnatural motion such as that of a thrown stone in the physics two five four b one zero and natural motion such as of a falling object in on the heavens three zero zero a two zero in violent motion as soon as the agent stops causing it the motion stops also in other words the natural state of an object is to be at rest since aristotle does not address friction with this understanding it can be observed that as aristotle stated heavy objects on the ground say require more force to make them move and objects pushed with greater force move faster this would imply the equation f mv incorrect in modern physics natural motion depends on the element concerned the aether naturally moves in a circle around the heavens while the four empedoclean elements move vertically up like fire as is observed or down like earth towards their natural resting places thumb upright one five aristotle s laws of motion in physics he states that objects fall at a speed proportional to their weight and inversely proportional to the density of the fluid they are immersed in this is a correct approximation for objects in earth s gravitational field moving in air or water in the physics two one five a two five aristotle effectively states a quantitative law that the speed v of a falling body is proportional say with constant c to its weight w and inversely proportional to the density of the fluid in which it is falling v c frac aristotle implies that in a vacuum the speed of fall would become infinite and concludes from this apparent absurdity that a vacuum is not possible opinions have varied on whether aristotle intended to state quantitative laws henri carteron held the extreme view that aristotle s concept of force was basically qualitative but other authors reject this archimedes corrected aristotle s theory that bodies move towards their natural resting places metal boats can float if they displace enough water floating depends in archimedes scheme on the mass and volume of the object not as aristotle thought its elementary composition aristotle s writings on motion remained influential until the early modern period john philoponus in the middle ages and galileo are said to have shown by experiment that aristotle s claim that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect a contrary opinion is given by carlo rovelli who argues that aristotle s physics of motion is correct within its domain of validity that of objects in the earth s gravitational field immersed in a fluid such as air in this system heavy bodies in steady fall indeed travel faster than light ones whether friction is ignored or not and they do fall more slowly in a denser medium newton s forced motion corresponds to aristotle s violent motion with its external agent but aristotle s assumption that the agent s effect stops immediately it stops acting e g the ball leaves the thrower s hand has awkward consequences he has to suppose that surrounding fluid helps to push the ball along to make it continue to rise even though the hand is no longer acting on it resulting in the medieval theory of impetus four causes thumb upright one five aristotle argued by analogy with woodwork that a thing takes its form from four causes in the case of a table the wood used material cause its design formal cause the tools and techniques used efficient cause and its decorative or practical purpose final cause aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors his term aitia is traditionally translated as cause but it does not always refer to temporal sequence it might be better translated as explanation but the traditional rendering will be employed here material cause describes the material out of which something is composed thus the material cause of a table is wood it is not about action it does not mean that one domino knocks over another domino the formal cause is its form i e the arrangement of that matter it tells one what a thing is that a thing is determined by the definition form pattern essence whole synthesis or archetype it embraces the account of causes in terms of fundamental principles or general laws as the whole i e macrostructure is the cause of its parts a relationship known as the whole part causation plainly put the formal cause is the idea in the mind of the sculptor that brings the sculpture into being a simple example of the formal cause is the mental image or idea that allows an artist architect or engineer to create a drawing the efficient cause is the primary source or that from which the change under consideration proceeds it identifies what makes of what is made and what causes change of what is changed and so suggests all sorts of agents non living or living acting as the sources of change or movement or rest representing the current understanding of causality as the relation of cause and effect this covers the modern definitions of cause as either the agent or agency or particular events or states of affairs in the case of two dominoes when the first is knocked over it causes the second also to fall over in the case of animals this agency is a combination of how it develops from the egg and how its body functions the final cause telos is its purpose the reason why a thing exists or is done including both purposeful and instrumental actions and activities the final cause is the purpose or function that something is supposed to serve this covers modern ideas of motivating causes such as volition in the case of living things it implies adaptation to a particular way of life optics aristotle describes experiments in optics using a camera obscura in problems book one five the apparatus consisted of a dark chamber with a small aperture that let light in with it he saw that whatever shape he made the hole the sun s image always remained circular he also noted that increasing the distance between the aperture and the image surface magnified the image chance and spontaneity according to aristotle spontaneity and chance are causes of some things distinguishable from other types of cause such as simple necessity chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things from what is spontaneous there is also more a specific kind of chance which aristotle names luck that only applies to people s moral choices astronomy in astronomy aristotle refuted democritus s claim that the milky way was made up of those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun s rays pointing out correctly that if the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun then the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them geology natural sciences thumb aristotle noted that the ground level of the aeolian islands changed before a volcanic eruption aristotle was one of the first people to record any geological observations he stated that geological change was too slow to be observed in one person s lifetime the geologist charles lyell noted that aristotle described such change including lakes that had dried up and deserts that had become watered by rivers giving as examples the growth of the nile delta since the time of homer and the upheaving of one of the aeolian islands previous to a volcanic eruption aristotle also made many observations about the hydrologic cycle and meteorology including his major writings meteorologica for example he made some of the earliest observations about desalination he observed early and correctly that when seawater is heated freshwater evaporates and that the oceans are then replenished by the cycle of rainfall and river runoff i have proved by experiment that salt water evaporated forms fresh and the vapor does not when it condenses condense into sea water again biology thumb upright among many pioneering zoological observations aristotle described the reproductive hectocotyl arm of the octopus bottom left empirical research aristotle was the first person to study biology systematically and biology forms a large part of his writings he spent two years observing and describing the zoology of lesbos and the surrounding seas including in particular the pyrrha lagoon in the centre of lesbos his data in history of animals generation of animals movement of animals and parts of animals are assembled from his own observations statements given by people with specialized knowledge such as beekeepers and fishermen and less accurate accounts provided by travellers from overseas his apparent emphasis on animals rather than plants is a historical accident his works on botany have been lost but two books on plants by his pupil theophrastus have survived aristotle reports on the sea life visible from observation on lesbos and the catches of fishermen he describes the catfish electric ray and frogfish in detail as well as cephalopods such as the octopus and paper nautilus his description of the hectocotyl arm of cephalopods used in sexual reproduction was widely disbelieved until the one nine th century he gives accurate descriptions of the four chambered fore stomachs of ruminants and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark he notes that an animal s structure is well matched to function so among birds the heron which lives in marshes with soft mud and lives by catching fish has a long neck and long legs and a sharp spear like beak whereas ducks that swim have short legs and webbed feet darwin too noted these sorts of differences between similar kinds of animal but unlike aristotle used the data to come to the theory of evolution aristotle s writings can seem to modern readers close to implying evolution but while aristotle was aware that new mutations or hybridizations could occur he saw these as rare accidents for aristotle accidents like heat waves in winter must be considered distinct from natural causes he was thus critical of empedocles s materialist theory of a survival of the fittest origin of living things and their organs and ridiculed the idea that accidents could lead to orderly results to put his views into modern terms he nowhere says that different species can have a common ancestor or that one kind can change into another or that kinds can become extinct scientific style thumb left upright one four aristotle inferred growth laws from his observations on animals including that brood size decreases with body mass whereas gestation period increases he was correct in these predictions at least for mammals data are shown for mouse and elephant aristotle did not do experiments in the modern sense he used the ancient greek term pepeiramenoi to mean observations or at most investigative procedures like dissection in generation of animals he finds a fertilized hen s egg of a suitable stage and opens it to see the embryo s heart beating inside instead he practiced a different style of science systematically gathering data discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals and inferring possible causal explanations from these this style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field such as genomics it does not result in the same certainty as experimental science but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed in this sense aristotle s biology is scientific from the data he collected and documented aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life history features of the live bearing tetrapods terrestrial placental mammals that he studied among these correct predictions are the following brood size decreases with adult body mass so that an elephant has fewer young usually just one per brood than a mouse lifespan increases with gestation period and also with body mass so that elephants live longer than mice have a longer period of gestation and are heavier as a final example fecundity decreases with lifespan so long lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short lived kinds like mice classification of living things thumb aristotle recorded that the embryo of a dogfish was attached by a cord to a kind of placenta the yolk sac like a higher animal this formed an exception to the linear scale from highest to lowest aristotle distinguished about five zero zero species of animals arranging these in the history of animals in a graded scale of perfection a nonreligious version of the scala naturae with man at the top his system had eleven grades of animal from highest potential to lowest expressed in their form at birth the highest gave live birth to hot and wet creatures the lowest laid cold dry mineral like eggs animals came above plants and these in turn were above minerals see also he grouped what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates as the hotter animals with blood and below them the colder invertebrates as animals without blood those with blood were divided into the live bearing mammals and the egg laying birds reptiles fish those without blood were insects crustacea non shelled cephalopods and shelled and the hard shelled molluscs bivalves and gastropods he recognised that animals did not exactly fit into a linear scale and noted various exceptions such as that sharks had a placenta like the tetrapods to a modern biologist the explanation not available to aristotle is convergent evolution philosophers of science have generally concluded that aristotle was not interested in taxonomy but zoologists who studied this question recently think otherwise he believed that purposive final causes guided all natural processes this teleological view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design psychology soul thumb upright one five aristotle proposed a three part structure for souls of plants animals and humans making humans unique in having all three types of soul aristotle s psychology given in his treatise on the soul peri psych s posits three kinds of soul psyches the vegetative soul the sensitive soul and the rational soul humans have a rational soul the human soul incorporates the powers of the other kinds like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally the unique part of the human rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and to compare them using the nous intellect and logos reason for aristotle the soul is the form of a living being because all beings are composites of form and matter the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings e g the ability to initiate movement or in the case of plants growth and chemical transformations which aristotle considers types of movement in contrast to earlier philosophers but in accordance with the egyptians he placed the rational soul in the heart rather than the brain notable is aristotle s division of sensation and thought which generally differed from the concepts of previous philosophers with the exception of alcmaeon memory according to aristotle in on the soul memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in the mind and to distinguish between the internal appearance and an occurrence in the past in other words a memory is a mental picture that can be recovered aristotle believed an impression is left on a semi fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory a memory occurs when stimuli such as sights or sounds are so complex that the nervous system cannot receive all the impressions at once these changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation aristotelian and thinking aristotle uses the term memory for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation and for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at a particular time and processing specific contents memory is of the past prediction is of the future and sensation is of the present retrieval of impressions cannot be performed suddenly a transitional channel is needed and located in past experiences both for previous experience and present experience because aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them as impressions people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences to search for these impressions people search the memory itself within the memory if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for recollection occurs when one retrieved experience naturally follows another if the chain of images is needed one memory will stimulate the next when people recall experiences they stimulate certain previous experiences until they reach the one that is needed recollection is thus the self directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory impression only humans can remember impressions of intellectual activity such as numbers and words animals that have perception of time can retrieve memories of their past observations remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed thumb upright two two five senses perception memory dreams action in aristotle s psychology impressions are stored in the sensorium the heart linked by his laws of association similarity contrast and contiguity aristotle believed the chain of thought which ends in recollection of certain impressions was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity contrast and contiguity described in his laws of association aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within the mind a force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience according to aristotle association is the power innate in a mental state which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences allowing them to rise and be recalled dreams aristotle describes sleep in on sleep and wakefulness sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses or of digestion so it is vital to the body while a person is asleep the critical activities which include thinking sensing recalling and remembering do not function as they do during wakefulness since a person cannot sense during sleep they cannot have desire which is the result of sensation however the senses are able to work during sleep albeit differently unless they are weary dreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus in dreams sensation is still involved but in an altered manner aristotle explains that when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water and then looks away the next thing they look at appears to have a wavelike motion when a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention it leaves an impression when the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored however during sleep the impressions made throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences so dreams result from these lasting impressions since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience during sleep a person is in an altered state of mind aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus for example a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings since a person sleeping is in a suggestible state and unable to make judgements they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams like the infatuated person this leads the person to believe the dream is real even when the dreams are absurd in nature in de anima iii three aristotle ascribes the ability to create to store and to recall images in the absence of perception to the faculty of imagination phantasia one component of aristotle s theory of dreams disagrees with previously held beliefs he claimed that dreams are not foretelling and not sent by a divine being aristotle reasoned naturalistically that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are simply coincidences aristotle claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it if a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred secondly any sensory experience that is perceived while a person is asleep does not qualify as part of a dream for example if while a person is sleeping a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut this sensory experience is not part of the dream lastly the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences practical philosophy aristotle s practical philosophy covers areas such as ethics politics economics and rhetoric ethics aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study i e one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake he wrote several treatises on ethics including most notably the nicomachean ethics aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function ergon of a thing an eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see because the proper function of an eye is sight aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans and that this function must be an activity of the psuch soul in accordance with reason logos aristotle identified such an optimum activity the virtuous mean between the accompanying vices of excess or deficiency of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action eudaimonia generally translated as happiness or sometimes well being to have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character thik aret often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately but by teachers and experience leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things when the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom phronesis and their intellect nous can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker or in other words a philosopher politics in addition to his works on ethics which address the individual aristotle addressed the city in his work titled politics aristotle considered the city to be a natural community moreover he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part he famously stated that man is by nature a political animal and argued that humanity s defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others aristotle s conception of the city is organic and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner thumb upright one five aristotle s classifications of political constitutions the common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from aristotle s understanding although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires the natural community according to aristotle was the city polis which functions as a political community or partnership koin nia the aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life and to perform beautiful acts the political partnership must be regarded therefore as being for the sake of noble actions not for the sake of living together this is distinguished from modern approaches beginning with social contract theory according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of fear of violent death or its inconveniences in protrepticus the character aristotle states as plato s disciple aristotle was rather skeptical concerning democracy and following plato s vague ideas he developed a coherent theory of integrating various forms of power into a so called mixed state to illustrate this approach aristotle proposed a first of its kind mathematical model of voting albeit textually described where the democratic principle of one voter one vote is combined with the oligarchic merit weighted voting for relevant quotes and their translation into mathematical formulas see economics aristotle made substantial contributions to economic thought especially to thought in the middle ages in politics aristotle addresses the city property and trade his response to criticisms of private property in lionel robbins s view anticipated later proponents of private property among philosophers and economists as it related to the overall utility of social arrangements aristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to society and that although private property is often blamed for social strife such evils in fact come from human nature in politics aristotle offers one of the earliest accounts of the origin of money money came into use because people became dependent on one another importing what they needed and exporting the surplus for the sake of convenience people then agreed to deal in something that is intrinsically useful and easily applicable such as iron or silver aristotle s discussions on retail and interest was a major influence on economic thought in the middle ages he had a low opinion of retail believing that contrary to using money to procure things one needs in managing the household retail trade seeks to make a profit it thus uses goods as a means to an end rather than as an end unto itself he believed that retail trade was in this way unnatural similarly aristotle considered making a profit through interest unnatural as it makes a gain out of the money itself and not from its use aristotle gave a summary of the function of money that was perhaps remarkably precocious for his time he wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good through a count of the number of other goods it is worth the necessity arises of a single universal standard of measurement money thus allows for the association of different goods and makes them commensurable he goes on to state that money is also useful for future exchange making it a sort of security that is if we do not want a thing now we shall be able to get it when we do want it rhetoric and poetics thumb upright one three five the blind oedipus commending his children to the gods one seven eight four by b nigne gagneraux in his poetics aristotle uses the tragedy oedipus tyrannus by sophocles as an example of how the perfect tragedy should be structured with a generally good protagonist who starts the play prosperous but loses everything through some hamartia fault aristotle s rhetoric proposes that a speaker can use three basic kinds of appeals to persuade his audience ethos an appeal to the speaker s character pathos an appeal to the audience s emotion and logos an appeal to logical reasoning he also categorizes rhetoric into three genres epideictic ceremonial speeches dealing with praise or blame forensic judicial speeches over guilt or innocence and deliberative speeches calling on an audience to make a decision on an issue aristotle also outlines two kinds of rhetorical proofs enthymeme proof by syllogism and paradeigma proof by example aristotle writes in his poetics that epic poetry tragedy comedy dithyrambic poetry painting sculpture music and dance are all fundamentally acts of mimesis imitation each varying in imitation by medium object and manner he applies the term mimesis both as a property of a work of art and also as the product of the artist s intention and contends that the audience s realisation of the mimesis is vital to understanding the work itself aristotle states that mimesis is a natural instinct of humanity that separates humans from animals and that all human artistry follows the pattern of nature because of this aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what stephen halliwell calls highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes for example music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone and poetry with language the forms also differ in their object of imitation comedy for instance is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average lastly the forms differ in their manner of imitation through narrative or character through change or no change and through drama or no drama while it is believed that aristotle s poetics originally comprised two books one on comedy and one on tragedy only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements plot structure character style thought spectacle and lyric poetry the characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story and the plot not the characters is the chief focus of tragedy tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions aristotle concludes poetics with a discussion on which if either is superior epic or tragic mimesis he suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music is more unified and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope it can be considered superior to epic aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles folklore and proverbs he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the delphic oracle and studied the fables of aesop views on women aristotle s analysis of procreation describes an active ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert passive female element on this ground proponents of feminist metaphysics have accused aristotle of misogyny and sexism however aristotle gave equal weight to women s happiness as he did to men s and commented in his rhetoric that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men influence more than two three zero zero years after his death aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived he contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence and he was the founder of many new fields according to the philosopher bryan magee it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did among countless other achievements aristotle was the founder of formal logic pioneered the study of zoology and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method taneli kukkonen writing in the classical tradition observes that his achievement in founding two sciences is unmatched and his reach in influencing every branch of intellectual enterprise including western ethical and political theory theology rhetoric and literary analysis is equally long as a result kukkonen argues any analysis of reality today will almost certainly carry aristotelian overtones evidence of an exceptionally forceful mind jonathan barnes wrote that an account of aristotle s intellectual afterlife would be little less than a history of european thought on his successor theophrastus thumb upright frontispiece to a one six four four version of theophrastus s historia plantarum originally written around three zero zero bc aristotle s pupil and successor theophrastus wrote the history of plants a pioneering work in botany some of his technical terms remain in use such as carpel from carpos fruit and pericarp from pericarpion seed chamber theophrastus was much less concerned with formal causes than aristotle was instead pragmatically describing how plants functioned on later greek philosophers the immediate influence of aristotle s work was felt as the lyceum grew into the peripatetic school aristotle s notable students included aristoxenus dicaearchus demetrius of phalerum eudemos of rhodes harpalus hephaestion mnason of phocis nicomachus and theophrastus aristotle s influence over alexander the great is seen in the latter s bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists botanists and researchers he had also learned a great deal about persian customs and traditions from his teacher although his respect for aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of aristotle s geography was clearly wrong when the old philosopher released his works to the public alexander complained thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines for in what shall i surpass other men if those doctrines wherein i have been trained are to be all men s common property on hellenistic science after theophrastus the lyceum failed to produce any original work though interest in aristotle s ideas survived they were generally taken unquestioningly it is not until the age of alexandria under the ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found the first medical teacher at alexandria herophilus of chalcedon corrected aristotle placing intelligence in the brain and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries noting that the latter pulse while the former do not though a few ancient atomists such as lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of aristotelian ideas about life teleology and after the rise of christianity natural theology would remain central to biological thought essentially until the one eight th and one nine th centuries ernst mayr states that there was nothing of any real consequence in biology after lucretius and galen until the renaissance on byzantine scholars greek christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of aristotle by copying all the extant greek language manuscripts of the corpus the first greek christians to comment extensively on aristotle were philoponus elias and david in the sixth century and stephen of alexandria in the early seventh century john philoponus stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of aristotle s views on the eternity of the world movement and other elements of aristotelian thought philoponus questioned aristotle s teaching of physics noting its flaws and introducing the theory of impetus to explain his observations after a hiatus of several centuries formal commentary by eustratius and michael of ephesus reappeared in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries apparently sponsored by anna comnena on the medieval islamic world thumb upright islamic portrayal of aristotle c one two two zero aristotle was one of the most revered western thinkers in early islamic theology most of the still extant works of aristotle as well as a number of the original greek commentaries were translated into arabic and studied by muslim philosophers scientists and scholars averroes avicenna and alpharabius who wrote on aristotle in great depth also influenced thomas aquinas and other western christian scholastic philosophers alkindus greatly admired aristotle s philosophy and averroes spoke of aristotle as the exemplar for all future philosophers medieval muslim scholars regularly described aristotle as the first teacher the title teacher was first given to aristotle by muslim scholars and was later used by western philosophers as in the famous poem of dante who were influenced by the tradition of islamic philosophy on medieval europe thumb upright left woodcut of aristotle ridden by phyllis by hans baldung one five one five with the loss of the study of ancient greek in the early medieval latin west aristotle was practically unknown there from c ad six zero zero to c one one zero zero except through the latin translation of the organon made by boethius in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries interest in aristotle revived and latin christians had translations made both from arabic translations such as those by gerard of cremona and from the original greek such as those by james of venice and william of moerbeke after the scholastic thomas aquinas wrote his summa theologica working from moerbeke s translations and calling aristotle the philosopher the demand for aristotle s writings grew and the greek manuscripts returned to the west stimulating a revival of aristotelianism in europe that continued into the renaissance these thinkers blended aristotelian philosophy with christianity bringing the thought of ancient greece into the middle ages scholars such as boethius peter abelard and john buridan worked on aristotelian logic the medieval english poet chaucer describes his student as being happy by having a cautionary medieval tale held that aristotle advised his pupil alexander to avoid the king s seductive mistress phyllis but was himself captivated by her and allowed her to ride him phyllis had secretly told alexander what to expect and he witnessed phyllis proving that a woman s charms could overcome even the greatest philosopher s male intellect artists such as hans baldung produced a series of illustrations of the popular theme the italian poet dante says of aristotle in the divine comedy besides dante s fellow poets the classical figure that most influenced the comedy is aristotle dante built up the philosophy of the comedy with the works of aristotle as a foundation just as the scholastics used aristotle as the basis for their thinking dante knew aristotle directly from latin translations of his works and indirectly quotations in the works of albert magnus dante even acknowledges aristotle s influence explicitly in the poem specifically when virgil justifies the inferno s structure by citing the nicomachean ethics on medieval judaism moses maimonides considered to be the foremost intellectual figure of medieval judaism adopted aristotelianism from the islamic scholars and based his guide for the perplexed on it and that became the basis of jewish scholastic philosophy maimonides also considered aristotle to be the greatest philosopher that ever lived and styled him as the chief of the philosophers also in his letter to samuel ibn tibbon maimonides observes that there is no need for samuel to study the writings of philosophers who preceded aristotle because the works of the latter are sufficient by themselves and superior to all that were written before them his intellect aristotle s is the extreme limit of human intellect apart from him upon whom the divine emanation has flowed forth to such an extent that they reach the level of prophecy there being no level higher on early modern scientists thumb william harvey s de motu cordis one six two eight showed that the blood circulated contrary to classical era thinking in the early modern period scientists such as william harvey in england and galileo galilei in italy reacted against the theories of aristotle and other classical era thinkers like galen establishing new theories based to some degree on observation and experiment harvey demonstrated the circulation of the blood establishing that the heart functioned as a pump rather than being the seat of the soul and the controller of the body s heat as aristotle thought galileo used more doubtful arguments to displace aristotle s physics proposing that bodies all fall at the same speed whatever their weight on one eight th one nine th century thinkers the one nine th century german philosopher friedrich nietzsche has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from aristotle aristotle rigidly separated action from production and argued for the deserved subservience of some people natural slaves and the natural superiority virtue arete of others it was martin heidegger not nietzsche who elaborated a new interpretation of aristotle intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition the english mathematician george boole fully accepted aristotle s logic but decided to go under over and beyond it with his system of algebraic logic in his one eight five four book the laws of thought this gives logic a mathematical foundation with equations enables it to solve equations as well as check validity and allows it to handle a wider class of problems by expanding propositions of any number of terms not just two charles darwin regarded aristotle as the most important contributor to the subject of biology in an one eight eight two letter he wrote that linnaeus and cuvier have been my two gods though in very different ways but they were mere schoolboys to old aristotle also in later editions of the book on the origin of species darwin traced evolutionary ideas as far back as aristotle the text he cites is a summary by aristotle of the ideas of the earlier greek philosopher empedocles james joyce s favoured philosopher was aristotle whom he considered to be the greatest thinker of all times samuel taylor coleridge said everybody is born either a platonist or an aristotelian ayn rand acknowledged aristotle as her greatest influence and remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend three a s aristotle aquinas and ayn rand she also regarded aristotle as the greatest of all philosophers karl marx considered aristotle to be the greatest thinker of antiquity and called him a giant thinker a genius and the great scholar modern rejection and rehabilitation thumb upright one three five that most enduring of romantic images aristotle tutoring the future conqueror alexander illustration by one eight six six during the two zero th century aristotle s work was widely criticized the philosopher bertrand russell argued that almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some aristotelian doctrine russell called aristotle s ethics repulsive and labelled his logic as definitely antiquated as ptolemaic astronomy russell stated that these errors made it difficult to do historical justice to aristotle until one remembered what an advance he made upon all of his predecessors the dutch historian of science eduard jan dijksterhuis wrote that aristotle and his predecessors showed the difficulty of science by proceeding so readily to frame a theory of such a general character on limited evidence from their senses in one nine eight five the biologist peter medawar could still state in pure seventeenth century tones that aristotle had assembled a strange and generally speaking rather tiresome farrago of hearsay imperfect observation wishful thinking and credulity amounting to downright gullibility hobbes rejected one of the most famous theses of aristotle s politics namely that human beings are naturally suited to life in a polis and do not fully realize their natures until they exercise the role of citizen by the start of the two one st century however aristotle was taken more seriously kukkonen noted that in the best two zero th century scholarship aristotle comes alive as a thinker wrestling with the full weight of the greek philosophical tradition alasdair macintyre has attempted to reform what he calls the aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and nietzscheans kukkonen observed too that that most enduring of romantic images aristotle tutoring the future conqueror alexander remained current as in the two zero zero four film alexander while the firm rules of aristotle s theory of drama have ensured a role for the poetics in hollywood biologists continue to be interested in aristotle s thinking armand marie leroi has reconstructed aristotle s biology while niko tinbergen s four questions based on aristotle s four causes are used to analyse animal behaviour they examine function phylogeny mechanism and ontogeny surviving works corpus aristotelicum thumb upright first page of a one five six six edition of the nicomachean ethics in greek and latin the works of aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the corpus aristotelicum these texts as opposed to aristotle s lost works are technical philosophical treatises from within aristotle s school reference to them is made according to the organization of immanuel bekker s royal prussian academy edition aristotelis opera edidit academia regia borussica berlin one eight three one one eight seven zero which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works loss and preservation aristotle wrote his works on papyrus scrolls the common writing medium of that era his writings are divisible into two groups the exoteric intended for the public and the esoteric for use within the lyceum school aristotle s lost works stray considerably in characterization from the surviving aristotelian corpus whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with a view to subsequent publication the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes not intended for publication cicero s description of aristotle s literary style as a river of gold must have applied to the published works not the surviving notes a major question in the history of aristotle s works is how the exoteric writings were all lost and how the ones now possessed came to be found the consensus is that andronicus of rhodes collected the esoteric works of aristotle s school which existed in the form of smaller separate works distinguished them from those of theophrastus and other peripatetics edited them and finally compiled them into the more cohesive larger works as they are known today legacy depictions paintings aristotle has been depicted by major artists including lucas cranach the elder justus van gent raphael paolo veronese

two eight it was inspired by the time that gershwin had spent in paris and evokes the sights and energy of the french capital during the ann es folles gershwin scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra plus celesta saxophones and automobile horns he brought back four parisian taxi horns for the new york premiere of the composition which took place on december one three one nine two eight in carnegie hall with walter damrosch conducting the new york philharmonic it was damrosch who had commissioned gershwin to write his concerto in f following the earlier success of rhapsody in blue one nine two four he completed the orchestration on november one eight less than four weeks before the work s premiere he collaborated on the original program notes with critic and composer deems taylor background although the story is likely apocryphal gershwin is said to have been attracted by maurice ravel s unusual chords and gershwin went on his first trip to paris in one nine two six ready to study with ravel after his initial student audition with ravel turned into a sharing of musical theories ravel said he could not teach him saying why be a second rate ravel when you can be a first rate gershwin gershwin strongly encouraged ravel to come to the united states for a tour to this end upon his return to new york gershwin joined the efforts of ravel s friend robert schmitz a pianist ravel had met during the war to urge ravel to tour the u s schmitz was the head of pro musica promoting franco american musical relations and was able to offer ravel a one zero zero zero zero fee for the tour an enticement gershwin knew would be important to ravel gershwin greeted ravel in new york in march one nine two eight during a party held for ravel s birthday by va gauthier ravel s tour reignited gershwin s desire to return to paris which he and his brother ira did after meeting ravel ravel s high praise of gershwin in an introductory letter to nadia boulanger caused gershwin to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in paris yet after he played for her she told him she could not teach him boulanger gave gershwin basically the same advice she gave all her accomplished master students what could i give you that you haven t already got this did not set gershwin back as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his rhapsody in blue paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers among them ezra pound w b yeats ernest hemingway and artist pablo picasso composition dis eis fis gis fis eis four dis eight fis four eis acciaccatura eis eight dis cis four cis acciaccatura eis eight dis cis two pos top caption themes from an american in paris gershwin based an american in paris on a melodic fragment called very parisienne written in one nine two six on his first visit to paris as a gift to his hosts robert and mabel schirmer gershwin called it a rhapsodic ballet it is written freely and in a much more modern idiom than his prior works gershwin explained in musical america my purpose here is to portray the impressions of an american visitor in paris as he strolls about the city listens to the various street noises and absorbs the french atmosphere the piece is structured into five sections which culminate in a loose aba format gershwin s first a episode introduces the two main walking themes in the allegretto grazioso and develops a third theme in the subito con brio the style of this a section is written in the typical french style of composers claude debussy and les six this a section featured duple meter singsong rhythms and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe english horn and taxi horns the b section s andante ma con ritmo deciso introduces the american blues and spasms of homesickness the allegro that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster twelve bar blues in the b section gershwin uses common time syncopated rhythms and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet saxophone and snare drum moderato con grazia is the last a section that returns to the themes set in a after recapitulating the walking themes gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section b in the final grandioso response gershwin did not particularly like walter damrosch s interpretation at the world premiere of an american in paris he stated that damrosch s sluggish dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work the audience according to edward cushing responded with a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music good and bad ordinarily arouses critics believed that an american in paris was better crafted than gershwin s concerto in f some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers c sar franck richard wagner or guillaume lekeu on its premiere gershwin responded to the critics instrumentation an american in paris was originally scored for three flutes three rd doubling on piccolo two oboes english horn two clarinets in b flat bass clarinet in b flat two bassoons contrabassoon four horns in f three trumpets in b flat three trombones tuba timpani snare drum bass drum triangle wood block ratchet cymbals low and high tom toms xylophone glockenspiel celesta four taxi horns labeled as a b c and d with circles around them alto saxophone tenor saxophone baritone saxophone all saxophones doubling soprano saxophones and strings although most modern audiences have heard the taxi horns using the notes a b c and d it had been gershwin s intention to use the notes a four b four d five and a four it is likely that in labeling the taxi horns as a b c and d with circles he was referring to the four horns and not the notes that they played a major revision of the work by composer and arranger f campbell watson simplified the instrumentation by reducing the saxophones to only three instruments alto tenor and baritone the soprano saxophone doublings were eliminated to avoid changing instruments and the contrabassoon was also deleted this became the standard performing edition until two zero zero zero when gershwin specialist jack gibbons made his own restoration of the original orchestration of an american in paris working directly from gershwin s original manuscript including the restoration of gershwin s soprano saxophone parts removed in campbell watson s revision gibbons restored orchestration of an american in paris was performed at london s queen elizabeth hall on july nine two zero zero zero by the city of oxford orchestra conducted by levon parikian william daly arranged the score for piano solo this was published by new world music in one nine two nine preservation status on september two two two zero one three it was announced that a musicological critical edition of the full orchestral score would be eventually released the gershwin family working in conjunction with the library of congress and the university of michigan were working to make scores available to the public that represent gershwin s true intent it was unknown whether the critical score would include the four minutes of material gershwin later deleted from the work such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster one two bar blues section or if the score would document changes in the orchestration during gershwin s composition process the score to an american in paris was scheduled to be issued first in a series of scores to be released the entire project was expected to take three zero to four zero years to complete but an american in paris was planned to be an early volume in the series two urtext editions of the work were published by the german publisher b note music in two zero one five the changes made by campbell watson were withdrawn in both editions in the extended urtext one two zero bars of music were re integrated conductor walter damrosch had cut them shortly before the first performance on september nine two zero one seven the cincinnati symphony orchestra gave the world premiere of the long awaited critical edition of the piece prepared by mark clague director of the gershwin initiative at the university of michigan this performance was of the original one nine two eight orchestration an alteration usually attributed to f campbell watson recordings an american in paris has been frequently recorded the first recording was made for the victor talking machine company in one nine two nine with nathaniel shilkret conducting the victor symphony orchestra drawn from members of the philadelphia orchestra gershwin was on hand to supervise the recording however shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio then a little later shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief celesta solo during the slow section so he hastily asked gershwin if he might play the solo gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording this recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that gershwin had intended using the notes a flat b flat a higher d and a lower a the radio broadcast of the september eight one nine three seven hollywood bowl george gershwin memorial concert in which an american in paris also conducted by shilkret was second on the program was recorded and was released in one nine nine eight in a two cd set arthur fiedler and the boston pops

assessed by the academy s voting membership the various category winners are awarded a copy of a golden statuette as a trophy officially called the academy award of merit although more commonly

winners were announced to the media three months earlier that was changed for the second ceremony in one nine three zero since then for the rest of the first decade the results were given to newspapers for publication at one one zero zero pm on the night of the awards this method was used until one nine four zero when the los angeles times announced the winners before the ceremony began as a result the academy has since one nine four one used a sealed envelope to reveal the names of the winners milestones the first best actor awarded was emil jannings for his performances in the last command and the way of all flesh he had to return to europe before the ceremony so the academy agreed to give him the prize earlier this made him the first academy award winner in history at that time winners were recognized for the entirety of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period for example jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period and janet gaynor later won a single oscar for performances in three films with the fourth ceremony however the system changed and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film for the first six ceremonies the eligibility period spanned two calendar years at the two nine th ceremony held in one nine five seven the best foreign language film category now known as best international feature film was introduced until then foreign language films had been honored with the special achievement award perhaps the most widely seen streaker in history was three four

four bemused host david niven quipped isn t it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings later evidence arose suggesting that opel s appearance was facilitated as a publicity stunt by the show s producer jack haley jr robert metzler the show s business manager believed that the incident had been planned in some way during the dress rehearsal niven had asked metzler s wife to borrow a pen so he could write down the famous line which was thus not the ad lib it appeared to be the seven four th academy

statuettes presented at the initial ceremonies were gold plated solid bronze within a few years the bronze was abandoned in favor of britannia metal a pewter like alloy which is then plated in copper nickel silver and finally two four karat gold due to a metal shortage during world war ii oscars were made of painted plaster for three years following the war the academy invited recipients to redeem the plaster figures for gold plated metal ones the only addition to the oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base the original oscar mold was cast in one nine two eight at the c w shumway oscar for the trophies in one nine three nine however the origin of the nickname is disputed one biography of bette davis who was a president of the academy in one nine four one claims she named the award after her first husband band leader harmon oscar nelson a frequently mentioned originator is margaret herrick the academy executive secretary who when she first saw the award in one nine three one said the statuette reminded her of uncle oscar a nickname for her cousin oscar pierce columnist sidney skolsky who was present during herrick s naming in one nine three one wrote that employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette oscar the academy credits skolsky with the first confirmed newspaper reference to oscar in his column on march one six one nine three four

disney was the first to thank the academy for his oscar during his acceptance speech engraving to prevent information identifying the oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates until two zero one zero winners returned their statuettes to the academy and had to wait several weeks to have their names inscribed on their respective

academy of motion picture arts and sciences ampas a professional honorary organization maintains a voting membership of over seven zero zero zero academy membership is divided into different branches with each representing a different discipline in film production actors constitute the largest voting bloc numbering one three one one members two two percent of the academy s composition votes have been certified by the auditing firm pricewaterhousecoopers and its predecessor price waterhouse since the seven th academy awards in one nine three five the firm mails the ballots of eligible nominees

submit a name based on other significant contributions to the field of motion pictures new membership proposals are considered annually the academy does not publicly disclose its membership although as recently as two zero zero seven press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join the two zero zero seven release also stated that it has just under six zero zero zero voting members while the membership had been growing stricter policies have kept its size steady since then in two zero one two the results of a study conducted by the los angeles times were published describing the demographic breakdown of approximately eight eight of ampas voting membership of the five one zero zero active voters confirmed nine four were caucasian seven seven were male and five four were found to be over the age of six zero three three of voting members are former nominees one four and winners one nine in may two zero one one the academy sent a letter advising its six zero zero zero or so voting members that an online system for oscar voting would be implemented in two zero one three rules according to rules two and three of the official academy awards rules a film must open in the previous calendar year from midnight at the start of january one to midnight at the end of december three one in los angeles county california and play for seven consecutive days to qualify except for the best international feature film best documentary feature and awards in short film categories additionally the film must be shown at least three times on each day of its qualifying run with at least one of the daily showings starting between six pm and one zero pm local time for example the two zero zero nine best picture winner the hurt locker was originally first released in two zero zero eight but did not qualify for the two zero zero eight awards as it did not play its oscar qualifying run in los angeles until mid two zero zero nine thus qualifying for the two zero zero nine awards foreign films must include english subtitles and each country can submit only one film for consideration in the international feature film category per year rule two states that a film must be feature length defined as a minimum of four zero minutes except for short subject awards and it must exist either on a three five mm or seven zero mm film print or in two four frame s or four eight frame s progressive scan digital cinema format with a minimum projector resolution of two zero four eight by one zero eight zero pixels since the nine zero th academy awards presented in two zero one eight multi part and limited series have been ineligible for the best documentary feature award this followed the win of o j made in america an eight hour presentation that was screened in a limited release before being broadcast in five parts on abc and espn in that category in two zero one seven the academy s announcement of the new rule made no direct mention of that film the best international feature film award does not require a u s release it requires the film to be submitted as its country s official selection the best documentary feature award requires either week long releases in both los angeles county and new york city during the previous calendar year or a qualifying award at a competitive film festival from the documentary feature qualifying festival list regardless of any public exhibition or distribution or submission in the international feature film category as its country s official selection the qualifying theatrical runs must meet the same requirements as those for non documentary films regarding numbers and times of screenings additionally a film must have been reviewed by a critic from the new york times time out new york the los angeles times or la weekly producers must submit an official screen credits online form before the deadline in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline the film will be ineligible for academy awards in any year the form includes the production credits for all related categories then each form is checked and put in a reminder list of eligible releases awards in short film categories best documentary short subject best animated short film and best live action short film have noticeably different eligibility rules from most other competitive awards first the qualifying period for release does not coincide with a calendar year instead of covering one year starting on october one and ending on september three zero of the calendar year before the ceremony second there are multiple methods of qualification the main method is a week long theatrical release in either los angeles county or new york city during the eligibility period films also can qualify by winning specified awards at one of several competitive film festivals designated by the academy also without regard to prior public distribution finally a film that is selected as a gold silver or bronze medal winner in an appropriate category of the immediately previous student academy awards is also eligible documentary category for that award and animation narrative alternative or international for the other awards the requirements for the qualifying theatrical run are also different from those for other awards only one screening per day is required for the documentary award the screening must start between noon and one zero pm local time for other awards no specific start time is required but the film must appear in regular theater listings with dates and screening times in late december ballots and copies of the reminder list of eligible releases are mailed to around six zero zero zero active members for most categories members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories i e only directors vote for directors writers for writers actors for actors etc in the special case of best picture all voting members are eligible to select the nominees in all major categories a variant of the single transferable vote is used with each member casting a ballot with up to five nominees ten for best picture ranked preferentially in certain categories including international feature film documentary and animated feature nominees are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches in most categories the winner is selected from among the nominees by plurality voting of all members since two zero zero nine the best picture winner has been chosen by instant runoff voting since two zero one three re weighted range voting has been used to select the nominees for the best visual effects film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for best picture in attempts to improve chances of receiving oscars and other movie awards conferred in oscar season the academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified it has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders for example a producer of the two zero zero nine best picture nominee the hurt locker was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the front runner the hurt locker eventually won academy screening room the academy screening room or academy digital screening room is a secure streaming platform which allows voting members of the academy to view all eligible films except initially those in the international category in one place it was introduced in two zero one nine for the two zero two zero oscars though dvd screeners and academy in person screenings were still provided for films to be included on the platform the north american distributor must pay one two five zero zero including a watermarking fee and a digital copy of the film to be prepared for streaming by the academy the platform can be accessed through an app on apple tv the watermarking process involved several video security firms creating a forensic watermark and restricting the ability to take screenshots or screen recordings in two zero two one for the two zero two two oscars the academy banned all physical screeners and in person screenings restricting official membership viewing to the academy screening room films eligible in the documentary and international categories were made available in different sections of the platform distributors can also pay an extra fee to add video featurettes to promote their films on the platform the in person screenings were said to be cancelled because of the covid one nine pandemic eligible films do not have to be added to the platform but the academy advertises them to voting members when they are awards ceremonies telecast three one st academy awards presentations pantages theatre hollywood one nine five nine eight one st academy awards presentations dolby theatre hollywood two zero zero nine the major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony commonly in late february or early march following the relevant calendar year and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees it is the culmination of the film awards season which usually begins during november or december of the previous year this is an elaborate extravaganza with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day black tie dress is the most common outfit for men although fashion may dictate not wearing a bow tie and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this the artists who recorded the nominees for best original song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast the academy awards is the world s longest running awards show televised live from the u s to all time zones in north america and worldwide and gathers billions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world the oscars were first televised in one nine five three by nbc which continued to broadcast the event until one nine six zero when abc took over televising the festivities including the first color broadcast of the event in one nine six six through one nine seven zero nbc regained the rights for five years then abc resumed broadcast duties in one nine seven six and its current contract with the academy runs through two zero two eight the academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets especially those outside of the americas in more desirable local timeslots the ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since one nine seven zero but only two south american countries chile and brazil purchased the rights to air the broadcast by that time the television rights to the academy awards had been sold in five zero countries a decade later the rights were already being sold to six zero countries and by one nine eight four the tv rights to the awards were licensed in seven six countries the ceremonies were moved up from late march early april to late february since two zero zero four to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with oscar season in the film industry another reason was because of the growing tv ratings success coinciding with the ncaa basketball tournament which would cut into the academy awards audience in one nine seven six and one nine seven seven abc s regained oscars were moved from tuesday to monday and went directly opposite nbc s ncaa title game the earlier date is also to the advantage of abc as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important february sweeps period some years the ceremony is moved into the first sunday of march to avoid a clash with the winter olympic games another reason for the move to late february and early march is also to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of passover and easter which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public advertising is somewhat restricted however as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official academy award sponsors may advertise during the telecast the production of the academy awards telecast currently holds the distinction of winning the most emmys in history with four seven wins and one nine five nominations overall since that award s own launch in one nine four nine after many years of being held on mondays at nine zero zero pm eastern six zero zero p m pacific since the one nine nine nine ceremonies it was moved to sundays at eight three zero pm et five three zero pm pt the reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on sundays that los angeles rush hour traffic jams could be avoided and an earlier start time would allow viewers on the east coast to go to bed earlier for many years the film industry opposed a sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office in two zero one zero the academy contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into january citing tv viewers fatigue with the film industry s long awards season however such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail furthermore a january ceremony on sunday would clash with national football league playoff games in two zero one eight the academy announced that the ceremony would be moved from late february to mid february beginning with the nine two nd academy awards in two zero two zero originally scheduled for april eight one nine six eight the four zero th academy awards ceremony was postponed for two days because of the assassination of dr martin luther king jr on march three zero one nine eight one the five three rd academy awards was postponed for one day after the shooting of president ronald reagan and others in washington d c in one nine nine three an in memoriam segment was introduced honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding one two months a selection compiled by a small committee of academy members this segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect with the segment having a popularity contest feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subject s cultural impact the applause has since been muted during the telecast and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead this segment was later followed by a commercial break in terms of broadcast length the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours the first oscars in one nine two nine lasted one five minutes at the other end of the spectrum the two zero zero two ceremony lasted four hours and twenty three minutes in two zero one zero the organizers of the academy awards announced winners acceptance speeches must not run past four five seconds this according to organizer bill mechanic was to ensure the elimination of what he termed the single most hated thing on the show overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion in two zero one six in a further effort to streamline speeches winners dedications were displayed on an on screen ticker during the two zero one eight ceremony host jimmy kimmel acknowledged how long the ceremony had become by announcing that he would give a brand new jet ski to whoever gave the shortest speech of the night a reward won by mark bridges when accepting his best costume design award for phantom thread the wall street journal analyzed the average minutes spent across the two zero one four two zero one eight telecasts as follows one four on song performances two five on the hosts speeches three eight on prerecorded clips and seven eight on the awards themselves broken into two four on the introduction and announcement two four on winners walking to the stage and three zero on their acceptance speeches although still dominant in ratings the viewership of the academy awards has steadily dropped the eight eight th academy awards were the lowest rated in the past eight years although with increases in male and one eight four nine viewership while the show itself also faced mixed reception following the show variety reported that abc was in negotiating an extension to its contract to broadcast the oscars seeking to have more creative control over the broadcast itself currently and nominally ampas is responsible for most aspects of the telecast including the choice of production staff and hosting although abc is allowed to have some input on their decisions in august two zero one six ampas extended its contract with abc through two zero two eight the contract neither contains any notable changes nor gives abc any further creative control over the telecast tv ratings historically the telecast s viewership is higher when box office hits are favored to win the best picture award more than five seven two five million viewers tuned to the telecast for the seven zero th academy awards in one nine nine eight the year of titanic which generated a box office haul during its initial one nine nine seven nine eight run of us six zero zero eight million in the us a box office record that would remain unsurpassed for years the seven six th academy awards ceremony in which the lord of the rings the return of the king pre telecast box office earnings of us three six eight million received one one awards including best picture drew four three five six million viewers the most watched ceremony based on nielsen ratings to date however was the four two nd academy awards best picture midnight cowboy which drew a four three four household rating on april seven one nine seven zero by contrast ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings despite how much critical acclaim those films have received the seven eight th academy awards which awarded low budget independent film crash with a pre oscar gross of us five three four million generated an audience of three eight six four million with a household rating of two two nine one in two zero zero eight the eight zero th academy awards telecast was watched by three one seven six million viewers on average with an one eight six six household rating the lowest rated and least watched ceremony at the time in spite of celebrating eight zero years of the academy awards the best picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independent film no country for old men whereas the nine two nd academy awards drew an average of two three six million viewers the nine three rd academy awards drew an even lower viewership of one zero four million that is the lowest viewership recorded by nielsen since it started recording audience totals in one nine seven four archive the academy film archive holds copies of every academy awards ceremony since the one nine four nine oscars and material on many prior ceremonies along with ancillary material related to more recent shows copies are held in a variety of film video and digital formats venues in one nine two nine the first academy awards were presented at a banquet dinner at the hollywood roosevelt hotel from one nine three zero to one nine four three the ceremony alternated between two venues the ambassador hotel on wilshire boulevard and the biltmore hotel in downtown los angeles grauman s chinese theatre in hollywood then hosted the awards from one nine four four to one nine four six followed by the shrine auditorium in los angeles from one nine four seven to one nine four eight the two one st academy awards in one nine four nine were held at the academy award theatre at what had been the academy s headquarters on melrose avenue in hollywood from one nine five zero to one nine six zero the awards were presented at hollywood s pantages theatre with the advent of television the awards from one nine five three to one nine five seven took place simultaneously in hollywood and new york first at the nbc international theatre one nine five three and then at the nbc century theatre after which the ceremony took place solely in los angeles the oscars moved to the santa monica civic auditorium in santa monica california in one nine six one by one nine six nine the academy decided to move the ceremonies back to downtown los angeles this time to the dorothy chandler pavilion at the los angeles county music center in the late one nine nine zero s and early two zero zero zero s the ceremony returned to the shrine in two zero zero two hollywood s dolby theatre previously known as the kodak theatre became the presentation s current venue awards of merit categories current categories in the first year of the awards the best directing award was split into two categories drama and comedy at times the best original score award has also been split into separate categories drama and comedy musical from the one nine three zero s through the one nine six zero s the art direction now production design cinematography and costume design awards were likewise split into two categories black and white films and color films prior to two zero one two the production design award was called art direction while the makeup and hairstyling award was called makeup in august two zero one eight the academy announced that several categories would not be televised live but rather be recorded during commercial breaks and aired later in the ceremony following dissent from academy members they announced that they would indeed air all two four categories live this followed several proposals among them the introduction of a popular film category that the academy had announced but did not implement discontinued categories proposed categories the board of governors meets each year and considers new award categories to date the following categories have been proposed best casting rejected in one nine nine nine best popular film proposed in two zero one eight for presentation at the two zero one nine ceremony postponed until the two zero two zero ceremony at the earliest yet to be implemented best stunt coordination rejected every year from one nine nine one to two zero one two best title design rejected in one nine

jean hersholt humanitarian award since one nine five seven irving g thalberg memorial award since one nine three eight academy special achievement award from one nine seven two to one nine nine five and again for two zero one seven discontinued special categories academy juvenile award one nine three four to one nine six zero criticism accusations of commercialism due to the positive exposure and prestige of the academy awards many studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the oscar season this has generated accusations of the academy awards being influenced more by marketing than by quality william friedkin an academy award winning film director and former producer of the ceremony expressed this sentiment at a conference in new york in two zero zero nine describing it as the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself tim dirks editor of amc s filmsite org has written of the academy awards a recent technique that has been claimed to be used during the oscar season is the whisper campaign these campaigns are intended to spread negative perceptions of other movies nominated and are believed to be perpetrated by those that were involved in creating the movie examples of whisper campaigns include the allegations against zero dark thirty suggesting that it justifies torture and the claim that lincoln distorts history accusations of bias typical criticism of the academy awards for best picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over representation of romantic historical epics biographical dramas romantic dramedies and family melodramas most of which are released in the u s in the last three months of the calendar year the oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded the term oscar bait was coined to describe such movies this has led at times to more specific criticisms that the academy is disconnected from the audience e g by favoring oscar bait over audience favorites or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues allegations of a lack of diversity the academy awards have long received criticism over its lack of diversity among the nominees this criticism is based on the statistics from every academy awards since one nine two nine which shows us that only six four of academy award nominees have been non white and since one nine nine one one one two of nominees have been non white with the rate of winners being even more polarizing due to a variety of reasons including marketability and historical bans on interracial couples a number of high profile oscars have been given to yellowface portrayals as well as performances of asian characters rewritten for white characters the eight eight th awards ceremony became the target of a boycott popularized on social media with the hashtag oscarssowhite based on activists perception that its all white acting nominee list reflected bias in response the academy initiated historic changes in membership by the year two zero two zero symbolism or sentimentalization acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for personal popularity to make up for a snub for a work that proved in time to be more popular or renowned than the one awarded or presented as a career honor to recognize a distinguished nominee s entire body of work recognition of streaming media film following the nine one st academy awards in february two zero one nine in which the netflix broadcast film roma had been nominated for ten awards including the best picture category steven spielberg and other members of the academy discussed changing the requirements through the board of governors for films as to exclude those from netflix and other media streaming services spielberg had been concerned that netflix as a movie production and distribution studio could spend much more than typical oscar winning films and have much wider and earlier distribution than other best picture nominated films while still being able to meet the minimal theatrical run status to qualify for an oscar the united states department of justice having heard of this potential rule change wrote a letter to the academy in march two zero one nine cautioning them that placing additional restrictions on films that originate from streaming media services without proper justification could raise anti trust concerns against the academy following its april two zero one nine board meeting the academy board of governors agreed to retain the current rules that allow for streaming media films to be eligible for oscars as long as they enjoy limited theatrical runs refusals of the award some winners critical of the academy awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their oscars the first to do so was screenwriter dudley nichols best writing in one nine three five for the informer nichols boycotted the eight th academy awards ceremony because of conflicts between the academy and the writers guild nichols eventually accepted the one nine three five award three years later at the one nine three eight ceremony nichols was nominated for three further academy awards during his career george c scott became the second person to refuse his award best actor in one nine seven zero for patton at the four three rd academy awards ceremony scott described it as a meat parade saying i don t want any part of it the third person to refuse the award was marlon brando who refused his award best actor for one nine seven two s the godfather citing the film industry s discrimination and mistreatment of native americans at the four five th academy awards ceremony brando asked actress and civil rights activist sacheen littlefeather to read a one five page speech in his place detailing

academy awards emmy awards and tony awards though some commentators worry that gender discrimination would cause men to dominate unsegregated categories other categories are unsegregated the grammy

originally published in one nine eight six followed by a tenth anniversary edition in one nine nine six and a two five th anniversary edition in two zero one two over four million copies have been sold worldwide a special numbered and signed anniversary edition was also published in one nine nine six with an embossed gold jacket synopsis animalia is an alliterative alphabet book and contains twenty six illustrations one for each letter of the alphabet each illustration features an animal from the animal kingdom a is for alligator and armadillo b is for butterfly etc along with a short poem utilizing the letter of the page for many of the words the illustrations contain many other objects beginning with that letter that the reader can try to identify however there are not necessarily a thousand things or maybe more as the author states as an additional challenge the author has hidden a picture of himself as a child in every picture here are some of the things in each picture that are truly different the alligator in the a section is wearing an apron featuring the alphabet which the book is about and this section also features the author s home country australia

it is a continuous scale of time without leap seconds it is the principal realisation of terrestrial time with a fixed offset of epoch it is also the basis for coordinated universal time utc which is used for civil timekeeping all over the earth s surface utc deviates from tai by a number of whole seconds when another leap second was put into effect utc is currently exactly three seven seconds behind tai the three seven seconds result from the initial difference of one zero seconds at the start of one nine seven two plus two seven leap seconds in utc since one nine seven two tai may be reported using traditional means of specifying days carried over from non uniform time standards based on the rotation of the earth specifically both julian days and the gregorian calendar are used tai in this form was synchronised with universal time at the beginning of one nine five eight and the two have drifted apart ever since due to the changing motion of the earth operation tai is a weighted average of the time kept by over four zero zero atomic clocks in over five zero national laboratories worldwide the majority of the clocks involved are caesium clocks the international system of units si definition of the second is based on caesium the clocks are compared using gps signals and two way satellite time and frequency transfer due to the signal averaging tai is an order of magnitude more stable than its best constituent clock the participating institutions each broadcast in real time a frequency signal with timecodes which is their estimate of tai time codes are usually published in the form of utc which differs from tai by a well known integer number of seconds these time scales are denoted in the form utc npl in the utc form where npl identifies the national physical laboratory uk the tai form may be denoted tai npl the latter is not to be confused with ta npl which denotes an independent atomic time scale not synchronised to tai or to anything else the clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other the international bureau of weights and measures bipm france combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible this combined time scale is published monthly in circular t and is the canonical tai this time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences utc utc k equivalent to tai tai k for each participating institution k the same circular also gives tables of tai ta k for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty circular t or by errata in a subsequent circular t aside from this once published in circular t the tai scale is not revised in hindsight it is possible to discover errors in tai and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale since the published circulars are definitive better estimates do not create another version of tai it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of terrestrial time tt history early atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock the atomic clocks were not operated continuously atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in one nine five five using the first caesium atomic clock at the national physical laboratory uk npl it was used as a basis for calibrating the quartz clocks at the royal greenwich observatory and to establish a time scale called greenwich atomic ga the united states naval observatory began the a one scale on one three september one nine five six using an atomichron commercial atomic clock followed by the nbs a scale at the national bureau of standards boulder colorado on nine october one nine five seven the international time bureau bih began a time scale tm or am in july one nine five five using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of vlf radio signals the bih scale a one and nbs a were defined by an epoch at the beginning of one nine five eight the procedures used by the bih evolved and the name for the time scale changed a three in one nine six four and ta bih in one nine six nine the si second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in one nine six seven from one nine seven one to one nine seven five the general conference on weights and measures and the international committee for weights and measures made a series of decisions which designated the bipm time scale international atomic time tai in the one nine seven zero s it became clear that the clocks participating in tai were ticking at different rates due to gravitational time dilation and the combined tai scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks starting from the julian date two four four three one four four five one january one nine seven seven zero zero zero zero zero zero corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks so that tai would correspond to proper time at the geoid mean sea level because the clocks were on average well above sea level this meant that tai slowed by about one part in a trillion the former uncorrected time scale continues to be published under the name eal echelle atomique libre meaning free atomic scale the instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for barycentric coordinate time tcb geocentric coordinate time tcg and terrestrial time tt which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system all three of these time scales were defined to read jd two four four three one four four five zero zero three seven two five one january one nine seven seven zero zero zero zero three two one eight four exactly at that instant tai was henceforth a realisation of tt with the equation tt tai tai three two one eight four s the continued existence of tai was questioned in a two zero zero seven letter from the bipm to the itu r which stated in the case of a redefinition of utc without leap seconds the cctf would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing tai as it would remain parallel to the continuous utc relation to utc utc is a discontinuous time scale it is occasionally adjusted by leap seconds between these adjustments it is composed of segments that are mapped to atomic time from its beginning in one nine six one through december one nine seven one the adjustments were made regularly in fractional leap seconds so that utc approximated ut two afterward these adjustments were made only in whole seconds to approximate ut one this was a compromise arrangement in order to enable a publicly broadcast time scale the less frequent whole second adjustments meant that the time scale would be more stable and easier to synchronize internationally the fact that it continues to approximate ut one means that tasks such as navigation which require a source of universal time continue to be well served by the public broadcast of utc see also clock synchronization network time protocol precision time protocol time and frequency transfer notes

definition utc gps loran and tai time scales giving alms to the poor is often considered an altruistic action altruism is the principle and moral practice of concern for happiness of other human beings or other animals resulting in a quality of life both material and spiritual it is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious and secular worldviews however the object s of concern vary among cultures and religions in an extreme case altruism may become a synonym of selflessness which is the opposite of selfishness the word altruism was popularized and possibly coined by the french philosopher auguste comte in french as altruisme for an antonym of egoism he derived it from the italian altrui which in turn was derived from latin alteri meaning other people or somebody else altruism in biological observations in field populations of the day organisms is an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves e g pleasure and quality of life time probability of survival or reproduction but benefits either directly or indirectly another individual without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action steinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting that is intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards in one sense the opposite of altruism is spite a spiteful action harms another with no self benefit altruism can be distinguished from feelings of loyalty or concern for the common good the latter are predicated upon social relationships whilst altruism does not consider relationships much debate exists as to whether true altruism is possible in human psychology the theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification the validity of this argument depends on whether intrinsic rewards qualify as benefits the term altruism may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others used in this sense it is usually contrasted with egoism which claims individuals are morally obligated to serve themselves first effective altruism is the use of evidence and reason to determine the most effective ways to benefit others the notion of altruism the concept has a long history in philosophical and ethical thought the term was originally coined in the one nine th century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science auguste comte and has become a major topic for psychologists especially evolutionary psychology researchers evolutionary biologists and ethologists whilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism in simple terms altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them scientific viewpoints anthropology marcel mauss s essay the gift contains a passage called note on alms this note describes the evolution of the notion of alms and by extension of altruism from the notion of sacrifice in it he writes alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand and of a notion of sacrifice on the other generosity is an obligation because nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it this is the ancient morality of the gift which has become a principle of justice the gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children evolutionary explanations upright giving alms to beggar children in the science of ethology the study of animal behaviour and more generally in the study of social evolution altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor in evolutionary psychology this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity emergency aid help to coalition partners tipping courtship gifts production of public goods and environmentalism theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from evolutionary game theory a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies some of the proposed mechanisms are kin selection that animals and humans are more altruistic towards close kin than to distant kin and non kin has been confirmed in numerous studies across many different cultures even subtle cues indicating kinship may unconsciously increase altruistic behavior one kinship cue is facial resemblance one study found that slightly altering photographs so that they more closely resembled the faces of study participants increased the trust the participants expressed regarding depicted persons another cue is having the same family name especially if rare and this has been found to increase helpful behavior another study found more cooperative behavior the greater the number of perceived kin in a group using kinship terms in political speeches increased audience agreement with the speaker in one study this effect was especially strong for firstborns who are typically close to their families vested interests people are likely to suffer if their friends allies and similar social ingroups suffer or even disappear helping such group members may therefore eventually benefit the altruist making ingroup membership more noticeable increases cooperativeness extreme self sacrifice towards the ingroup may be adaptive if a hostile outgroup threatens to kill the entire ingroup reciprocal altruism see also reciprocity evolution direct reciprocity research shows that it can be beneficial to help others if there is a chance that they can and will reciprocate the help the effective tit for tat strategy is one game theoretic example many people seem to be following a similar strategy by cooperating if and only if others cooperate in return one consequence is that people are more cooperative if it is more likely that individuals will interact again in the future people tend to be less cooperative if they perceive that the frequency of helpers in the population is lower they tend to help less if they see non cooperativeness by others and this effect tend to be stronger than the opposite effect of seeing cooperative behaviors simply changing the cooperative framing of a proposal may increase cooperativeness such as calling it a community game instead of a wall street game a tendency towards reciprocity implies that people will feel obligated to respond if someone helps them this has been used by charities that give small gifts to potential donors hoping thereby to induce reciprocity another method is to announce publicly that someone has given a large donation the tendency to reciprocate can even generalize so people become more helpful toward others in general after being helped on the other hand people will avoid or even retaliate against those perceived not to be cooperating people sometimes mistakenly fail to help when they intended to or their helping may not be noticed which may cause unintended conflicts as such it may be an optimal strategy to be slightly forgiving of and have a slightly generous interpretation of non cooperation people are more likely to cooperate on a task if they can communicate with one another first this may be due to better assessments of cooperativeness or due to exchange of promises they are more cooperative if they can gradually build trust instead of being asked to give extensive help immediately direct reciprocity and cooperation in a group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from intra group competition to larger scale competitions such as between groups or against the general population thus giving grades and promotions based only on an individual s performance relative to a small local group as is common may reduce cooperative behaviors in the group indirect reciprocity the avoidance of poor reciprocators and cheaters causes a person s reputation to become very important a person with a good reputation for reciprocity has a higher chance of receiving help even from persons they have had no direct interactions with previously strong reciprocity a form of reciprocity where some individuals seem to spend more resources on cooperating and punishing than would be most beneficial as predicted by several established theories of altruism a number of theories have been proposed as explanations as well as criticisms regarding its existence pseudo reciprocity an organism behaves altruistically and the recipient does not reciprocate but has an increased chance of acting in a way that is selfish but also as a byproduct benefits the altruist costly signaling and the handicap principle since altruism takes away resources from the altruist it can be an honest signal of resource availability and the abilities needed to gather resources this may signal to others that the altruist is a valuable potential partner it may also be a signal of interactive and cooperative intentions since those not interacting further in the future gain nothing from the costly signaling it is unclear if costly signaling can indicate a long term cooperative personality but people have increased trust for those who help costly signaling is pointless if everyone has the same traits resources and cooperative intentions but become a potentially more important signal if the population increasingly varies on these characteristics hunters widely sharing the meat has been seen as a costly signal of ability and research has found that good hunters have higher reproductive success and more adulterous relations even if they themselves receive no more of the hunted meat than anyone else similarly holding large feasts and giving large donations has been seen as ways of demonstrating one s resources heroic risk taking has also been interpreted as a costly signal of ability volunteers assist hurricane victims at the houston astrodome following hurricane katrina both indirect reciprocity and costly signaling depend on the value of reputation and tend to make similar predictions one is that people will be more helping when they know that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later is publicly announced is discussed or is simply being observed by someone else this have been documented in many studies the effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of a logo on a computer screen weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by a desire to be seen as altruistic people who know that they are publicly monitored sometimes even wastefully donate money they know are not needed by recipient which may be because of reputational concerns women have been found to find altruistic men to be attractive partners when looking for a long term partner altruism may be a preferred trait as it may indicate that he is also willing to share resources with her and her children it has been shown that men perform altruistic acts in the early stages of a romantic relationship or simply when in the presence of an attractive woman while both sexes state that kindness is the most preferable trait in a partner there is some evidence that men place less value on this than women and that women may not be more altruistic in presence of an attractive man men may even avoid altruistic women in short term relationships which may be because they expect less success people may compete for social benefit from a burnished reputation which may cause competitive altruism on the other hand in some experiments a proportion of people do not seem to care about reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous this may possibly be due to reasons such as psychopathy or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen to be altruistic the reputational benefits of altruism occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the present while humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costs benefits as compared to those in the present some have shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less cooperative explicit extrinsic rewards and punishments have been found to sometimes actually have the opposite effect on behaviors compared to intrinsic rewards this may be because such extrinsic top down incentives may replace partially or in whole intrinsic and reputational incentives motivating the person to focus on obtaining the extrinsic rewards which overall may make the behaviors less desirable another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them this may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists especially by those who are non cooperators a counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing no good at all group selection it has controversially been argued by some evolutionary scientists such as david sloan wilson that natural selection can act at the level of non kin groups to produce adaptations that benefit a non kin group even if these adaptations are detrimental at the individual level thus while altruistic persons may under some circumstances be outcompeted by less altruistic persons at the individual level according to group selection theory the opposite may occur at the group level where groups consisting of the more altruistic persons may outcompete groups consisting of the less altruistic persons such altruism may only extend to ingroup members while there may instead prejudice and antagonism against outgroup members see also in group favoritism group selection theory has been criticized by many other evolutionary scientists helping the homeless in new york city such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their inclusive fitness when they are doing altruistic acts instead evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms such as emotions that promote altruistic behaviors every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment this need not imply that on average five zero or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits the benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no kin to friends than to strangers to those attractive than to those unattractive to non competitors than to competitors and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup the study of altruism was the initial impetus behind george r price s development of the price equation which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution an interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular slime moulds such as dictyostelium mucoroides these protists live as individual amoebae until starved at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds and associated emotional cognitive and neurohormonal mechanisms evolved in order to facilitate long term high cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left wing politics such by the russian zoologist and anarchist peter kropotkin in his one nine zero two book mutual aid a factor of evolution and moral philosopher peter singer in his book a darwinian left neurobiology jorge moll and jordan grafman neuroscientists at the national institutes of health and labs d or hospital network j m provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging in their research published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences usa in october two zero zero six they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic reward pathway a primitive part of the brain that usually responds to food and sex however when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations another brain circuit was selectively activated the subgenual cortex septal region these structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species altruism the experiment suggested was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain hard wired and pleasurable one brain region the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex basal forebrain contributes to learning altruistic behavior especially in those with trait empathy the same study has shown a connection between giving to charity and the promotion of social bonding in fact in an experiment published in march two zero zero seven at the university of southern california neuroscientist antonio r damasio and his colleagues showed that subjects with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex lack the ability to empathically feel their way to moral answers and that when confronted with moral dilemmas these brain damaged patients coldly came up with end justifies the means answers leading damasio to conclude that the point was not that they reached immoral conclusions but that when they were confronted by a difficult issue in this case as whether to shoot down a passenger plane hijacked by terrorists before it hits a major city these patients appear to reach decisions without the anguish that afflicts those with normally functioning brains according to adrian raine a clinical neuroscientist also at the university of southern california one of this study s implications is that society may have to rethink how it judges immoral people psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse without that awareness people relying exclusively on reasoning seem to find it harder to sort their way through moral thickets does that mean they should be held to different standards of accountability in another study in the one nine nine zero s dr bill harbaugh a university of oregon economist concluded people are motivated to give for reasons of personal prestige and in a similar fmri scanner test in two zero zero seven with his psychologist colleague dr ulrich mayr reached the same conclusions of jorge moll and jordan grafman about giving to charity although they were able to divide the study group into two groups egoists and altruists one of their discoveries was that though rarely even some of the considered egoists sometimes gave more than expected because that would help others leading to the conclusion that there are other factors in cause in charity such as a person s environment and values psychology the international encyclopedia of the social sciences defines psychological altruism as a motivational state with the goal of increasing another s welfare psychological altruism is contrasted with psychological egoism which refers to the motivation to increase one s own welfare there has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruism some definitions specify a self sacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors however because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question the social exchange theory postulates that altruism only exists when benefits to the self outweigh costs to the self daniel batson is a psychologist who examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory he identified four major motives to ultimately benefit the self egoism to ultimately benefit the other person altruism to benefit a group collectivism or to uphold a moral principle principlism altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism but the general conclusion has been that empathy induced altruism can be genuinely selfless the empathy altruism hypothesis basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions and increase their own positive ones through helping someone in need empathy is thus not selfless since altruism works either as the way to avoid those negative unpleasant feelings and have positive pleasant feelings triggered by others need for help or as the way to incentive the gain of social reward or through fear to avoid social punishment by helping people with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to another s suffering helping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues peace corps trainees swearing in as volunteers in cambodia four april two zero zero seven in psychological research on altruism studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping comforting sharing cooperation philanthropy and community service research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person s distress research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping the bystander effect greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility however a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders many studies have observed the effects of volunteerism as a form of altruism on happiness and health and have consistently found a strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and well being in a study of older adults those who volunteered were higher on life satisfaction and will to live and lower in depression anxiety and somatization volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health but physical health and longevity as well attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages one study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a three zero year period and found that five two of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only three six of those who did volunteer experienced one a study on adults ages five five found that during the four year study period people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a six three lower likelihood of dying after controlling for prior health status it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a four four reduction in mortality merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater well being a study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness it is important to note that while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness it has also been found to work in the opposite direction that happier people are also kinder the relationship between altruistic behavior and happiness is bidirectional studies have found that generosity increases linearly from sad to happy affective states studies have also been careful to note that feeling over taxed by the needs of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness for example one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one although positive effects were still significant additionally while generous acts make people feel good about themselves it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others studies suggest that gratitude goes hand in hand with kindness and is also very important for our well being a study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals positive affect offering emotional support sleep quality and well being pathological altruism pathological altruism is when altruism is taken to an unhealthy extreme and either harms the altruistic person or well intentioned actions cause more harm than good the term pathological altruism was popularised by the book pathological altruism examples include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of one s own needs hoarding of animals and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid sociology sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society altruism morality and social solidarity american sociological association the structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable philanthropic and other pro social altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field the american sociology association asa acknowledges public sociology saying the intrinsic scientific policy and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct good societies is unquestionable altruism morality and social solidarity asa this type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies how altruism is framed organized carried out and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and build the good society the motivation of altruism is also the focus of study some publications link the occurrence of moral outrage to the punishment of perpetrators and compensation of victims studies have shown that generosity in laboratory and in online experiments is contagious people imitate observed generosity of others religious viewpoints most if not all of the world s religions promote altruism as a very important moral value buddhism christianity hinduism islam jainism judaism and sikhism etc place particular emphasis on altruistic morality buddhism monks collecting alms altruism figures prominently in buddhism love and compassion are components of all forms of buddhism and are focused on all beings equally love is the wish that all beings be happy and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion these qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness and the need for them lies at the very core of our being dalai lama speech by the dalai lama the phrase core of our being is freudian see still the notion of altruism is modified in such a world view since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness the more we care for the happiness of others the greater our own sense of well being becomes dalai lama in the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative unhappy consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment but from the law of karma which functions like a natural law of cause and effect a simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes if one causes suffering then as a natural consequence one would experience suffering if one causes happiness then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness jainism sculpture depicting the jain concept of ahimsa non injury the fundamental principles of jainism revolve around the concept of altruism not only for humans but for all sentient beings jainism preaches the view of ahimsa to live and let live thereby not harming sentient beings i e uncompromising reverence for all life it also considers all living things to be equal the first tirthankara rishabhdev introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation giving oneself up for others non violence and compassion for all living things jainism prescribes a path of non violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal a major characteristic of jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors one s unconquered mind with anger pride ego deceit greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans anger spoils good relations pride destroys humility deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness pride by humility deceit by straightforwardness and greed by contentment jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation one must practice the following ethical principles major vows in thought speech and action the degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks they are non violence ahimsa truthfulness satya non stealing asteya celibacy brahmacharya non possession or non materialism aparigraha the great vows mahavrata are prescribed for monks and limited vows anuvrata are prescribed for householders the house holders are encouraged to practice the above mentioned five vows the monks have to observe them very strictly with consistent practice it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually accelerating the spiritual progress the principle of nonviolence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become siddha god in jainism because all living beings possess a soul great care and awareness is essential in one s actions jainism emphasizes the equality of all life advocating harmlessness towards all whether the creatures are great or small this policy extends even to microscopic organisms jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders christianity st thomas aquinas interprets you should love your neighbour as yourself as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others considering that the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship and quotes aristotle that the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves we naturally seek the common good the good of the whole more than any private good the good of a part however he thinks we should love god more than ourselves and our neighbours and more than our bodily life since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude a more desirable thing than bodily well being in coining the word altruism as stated above comte was probably opposing this thomistic doctrine which is present in some theological schools within catholicism many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of god one john four states that for one to love god one must love his fellowman and that hatred of one s fellowman is the same as hatred of god thomas jay oord has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love an altruistic action is not always a loving action oord defines altruism as acting for the other s good and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one s own good when the other s demands undermine overall well being german philosopher max scheler distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak one way is a sincere expression of christian love motivated by a powerful feeling of security strength and inner salvation of the invincible fullness of one s own life and existence another way is merely one of the many modern substitutes for love nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people s business at its worst scheler says love for the small the poor the weak and the oppressed is really disguised hatred repressed envy an impulse to detract etc directed against the opposite phenomena wealth strength power largesse islam in islam the concept th r altruism is the notion of preferring others to oneself for sufis this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one s own concerns where concern for others is deemed as a demand made by allah i e god on the human body considered to be property of allah alone the importance of th r lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good islam considers those practicing th r as abiding by the highest degree of nobility this is similar to the notion of chivalry but unlike that european concept in th r attention is focused on everything in existence a constant concern for allah results in a careful attitude towards people animals and other things in this world judaism judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation the famous rabbi abraham isaac kook stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity this is defined as bestowal or giving which is the intention of altruism this can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or god kabbalah defines god as the force of giving in existence rabbi moshe chaim luzzatto in particular focused on the purpose of creation and how the will of god was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force modern kabbalah developed by rabbi yehuda ashlag in his writings about the future generation focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism love for one another ashlag focused on society and its relation to divinity sikhism altruism is essential to the sikh religion the central faith in sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love affection sacrifice patience harmony truthfulness the concept of seva or selfless service to the community for its own sake is an important concept in sikhism the fifth guru arjun dev sacrificed his life to uphold two two carats of pure truth the greatest gift to humanity the guru granth the ninth guru tegh bahadur sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity in the late seventeenth century guru gobind singh the tenth guru in sikhism was at war with the mughal rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow sikh bhai kanhaiya attended the troops of the enemy he gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield some of the enemy began to fight again and some sikh warriors were annoyed by bhai kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy sikh soldiers brought bhai kanhaiya before guru gobind singh and complained of his action that they considered counterproductive to their struggle on the battlefield what were you doing and why asked the guru i was giving water to the wounded because i saw your face in all of them replied bhai kanhaiya the guru responded then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds you were practicing what you were coached in the house of the guru under the tutelage of the guru bhai kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism which is still engaged today in doing good to others and in training new recruits for this service hinduism in hinduism selflessness atmatyag love prema kindness daya and forgiveness kshama are considered as the highest acts of humanity or manushyattva giving alms to the beggers or poor people is considered as a divine act or punya and hindus believe it will free their souls from guilt or paapa and will led them to heaven or swarga in afterlife altruism is also the central act of various hindu mythology and religious poems and songs the founder of warkari samprdaya the great saint dhnyaneshwar maharaj one two seven five one two nine six in his pasaydan pray to the supreme lord vitthal for the wellbeing of all living organisms of the universe swami vivekananda the legendary hindu monk has said jive prem kare jeijon seijon sebiche iswar whoever loves any living being is serving god mass donation of clothes to poor people vastraseva or blood donation camp or mass food donation annaseva for poor people is common in various hindu religious ceremonies swami sivananda an advaita scholar reiterates the views in his commentary synthesising vedanta views on the brahma sutras a vedantic text in his commentary on chapter three of the brahma sutras sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short lived and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed hence karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one s merit furthermore one cannot argue that karma generates apurva or punya which gives fruit since apurva is non sentient it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god it cannot independently bestow reward or punishment however the very well known and popular text the bhagavad gita supports the doctrine of karma yoga achieving oneness with god through action nishkam karma or action without expectation desire for personal gain which can be said to encompass altruism altruistic acts are generally celebrated and very well received in hindu literature and is central to hindu morality philosophy there exists a wide range of philosophical views on humans obligations or motivations to act altruistically proponents of ethical altruism maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically the opposing view is ethical egoism which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self interest both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with utilitarianism which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co inhabitants a related concept in descriptive ethics is psychological egoism the thesis that humans always act in their own self interest and that true altruism is impossible rational egoism is the view that rationality consists in acting in one s self interest without specifying how this affects one s moral obligations effective altruism effective altruism is a philosophy and social movement that uses evidence and reasoning to determine the most effective ways to benefit others effective altruism encourages individuals to consider all causes and actions and to act in the way that brings about the greatest positive impact based upon their values it is the broad evidence based and cause neutral approach that distinguishes effective altruism from traditional altruism or charity effective altruism is part of the larger movement towards evidence based practices while a substantial proportion of effective altruists have focused on the nonprofit sector the philosophy of effective altruism applies more broadly to prioritizing the scientific projects companies and policy initiatives which can be estimated to save lives help people or otherwise have the biggest benefit people associated with the

rejected faith and religion she supported rational and ethical egoism and rejected altruism in politics she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and opposed collectivism statism and anarchism instead she supported laissez faire capitalism which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights including private property rights although rand opposed libertarianism which she viewed as anarchism she is often associated with the modern libertarian movement in the united states in art rand promoted romantic realism she was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her except for aristotle thomas aquinas and classical liberals rand s fiction received mixed reviews from literary critics although academic interest in her ideas has grown since her death academic philosophers have generally ignored or rejected her philosophy because of her polemical approach and lack of methodological rigor her writings have politically

essay about the polish actress pola negri which became her first published work by this time she had decided her professional surname for writing would be rand possibly because it is graphically similar to a vowelless excerpt of her birth surname in cyrillic she adopted the first name ayn some biographical sources question this suggesting it may come from a nickname based on the hebrew word

cover of the fountainhead the fountainhead was rand s first bestseller rand s first major success as a writer came in one nine four three with the fountainhead a romantic and philosophical novel that

others placing others above themselves twelve publishers rejected it before the bobbs merrill company finally accepted it at the insistence of editor archibald ogden who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it while completing the novel rand was prescribed the amphetamine benzedrine to fight fatigue the drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the novel but afterwards she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks rest her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings the fountainhead became a worldwide success bringing rand fame and financial security in one nine four three she sold the film rights to warner bros and returned to hollywood

with nathaniel branden turned into a romantic affair with the knowledge of their spouses published in one nine five seven atlas shrugged was considered rand s magnum opus she described the novel s theme as the role of the mind in man s existence and as a corollary the demonstration of a new moral philosophy the morality of rational self interest it advocates the core tenets of rand s philosophy of objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement the plot involves a dystopian united states in which the most creative industrialists scientists and artists respond to a welfare state government by going on strike and retreating to a hidden valley where they build an independent free economy the novel s hero and leader of the strike john galt describes it as stopping the motor of the world by withdrawing the minds of the individuals contributing most to the nation s wealth and achievements with this fictional strike rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive the economy would collapse and society would fall apart the novel includes elements of mystery romance and science fiction and contains an extended exposition of objectivism in a lengthy monologue delivered by galt despite many negative reviews atlas shrugged became an international bestseller however the reaction of intellectuals to the novel discouraged and depressed rand atlas shrugged was her last completed work of fiction marking the end of her career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher in one nine five eight nathaniel branden established the nathaniel branden lectures later incorporated as the nathaniel branden institute nbi to promote rand s philosophy collective members gave lectures for the nbi and wrote articles for objectivist periodicals that rand edited she later published some of these articles in book form rand was unimpressed by many of the nbi students and held them to strict standards sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her critics including some former nbi students and branden himself later described the culture of the nbi as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for rand some described the nbi or the objectivist movement as a cult or religion rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair some of her followers mimicked her preferences wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers however some former nbi students believed the extent of these behaviors was exaggerated and the problem was concentrated among rand s closest followers in new york later years throughout the one nine six zero s and one nine seven zero s rand developed and promoted her objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as yale princeton columbia harvard and the massachusetts institute of technology she began delivering annual lectures at the ford hall forum responding to questions from the audience during these appearances she often took controversial stances on the political and social issues of the day these included supporting abortion rights opposing the vietnam war and the military draft but condemning many draft dodgers as bums supporting israel in the yom kippur war of one nine seven three against a coalition of arab nations as civilized men fighting savages saying european colonists had the right to invade and take land inhabited by american indians and calling homosexuality immoral and disgusting while also advocating the repeal of all laws concerning it she endorsed several republican candidates for president of the united states most strongly barry goldwater in one nine six four whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for the objectivist newsletter alt twin gravestone bearing the names frank o connor and ayn rand o connor grave marker for rand and her husband at kensico cemetery in valhalla new york in one nine six four nathaniel branden began an affair with the young actress patrecia scott whom he later married nathaniel and barbara branden kept the affair hidden from rand when she learned of it in one nine six eight though her romantic relationship with branden had already ended rand ended her relationship with both brandens and the nbi was closed she published an article in the objectivist repudiating nathaniel branden for dishonesty and other irrational behavior in his private life in subsequent years rand and several more of her closest associates parted company rand underwent surgery for lung cancer in one nine seven four after decades of heavy smoking in one nine seven six she retired from writing her newsletter and after her initial objections allowed a social worker employed by her attorney to enroll her in social security and medicare during the late one nine seven zero s her activities within the objectivist movement declined especially after the death of her husband on november nine one nine seven nine one of her final projects was work on a never completed television adaptation of atlas shrugged on march six one nine eight two rand died of heart failure at her home in new york city she was interred in the kensico cemetery valhalla new york at her funeral a floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket in her will rand named leonard peikoff as her beneficiary literary method and influences rand described her approach to literature as romantic realism she wanted her fiction to present the world as it could be and should be rather than as it was this approach led her to create highly stylized situations and characters her fiction typically has protagonists who are heroic individualists depicted as fit and attractive her stories villains support duty and collectivist moral ideals rand often describes them as unattractive and they sometimes have names that suggest negative traits like wesley mouch in atlas shrugged rand considered plot a critical element of literature and her stories typically have what biographer anne heller described as tight elaborate fast paced plotting romantic triangles are a common plot element in rand s fiction in most of her novels and plays the main female character is romantically involved with at least two different men influences upright alt photo of victor hugo rand admired the novels of french author victor hugo in school rand read works by fyodor dostoevsky victor hugo edmond rostand and friedrich schiller who became her favorites she considered them to be among the top rank of romantic writers because of their focus on moral themes and their skill at constructing plots hugo in particular was an important influence on her writing especially her approach to plotting in the introduction she wrote for an english language edition of his novel ninety three rand called him the greatest novelist in world literature although rand disliked most russian literature her depictions of her heroes show the influence of the russian symbolists and other nineteenth century russian writing most notably the one eight six three novel what is to be done by nikolay chernyshevsky rand s experience of the russian revolution and early communist russia influenced the portrayal of her villains this is most apparent in we the living set in russia the ideas and rhetoric of ellsworth toohey in the fountainhead and the destruction of the economy by the looters in atlas shrugged also reflect it rand s descriptive style echoes her early career writing scenarios and scripts for movies her novels have many narrative descriptions that resemble early hollywood movie scenarios they often follow common film editing conventions such as having a broad establishing shot description of a scene followed by close up details and her descriptions of women characters often take a male gaze perspective philosophy rand called her philosophy objectivism describing its essence as the concept of man as a heroic being with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life with productive achievement as his noblest activity and reason as his only absolute she considered objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics epistemology ethics political philosophy and aesthetics in metaphysics rand supported philosophical realism and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism including all forms of religion rand believed in free will as a form of agent causation and rejected determinism in epistemology she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception the validity of which rand considered axiomatic and reason which she described as the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man s senses rand rejected all claims of non perceptual or a priori knowledge including instinct intuition revelation or any form of just knowing in her introduction to objectivist epistemology rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the analytic synthetic dichotomy in ethics rand argued for rational and ethical egoism rational self interest as the guiding moral principle she said the individual should exist for his own sake neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself rand referred to egoism as the virtue of selfishness in her book of that title in it she presented her solution to the is ought problem by describing a meta ethical theory that based morality in the needs of man s survival qua man she condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness and held the initiation of force was evil and irrational writing in atlas shrugged that force and mind are opposites rand s political philosophy emphasized individual rights including property rights she considered laissez faire capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on protecting those rights rand opposed statism which she understood included theocracy absolute monarchy nazism fascism communism democratic socialism and dictatorship she believed a constitutionally limited government should protect natural rights although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian rand preferred the term radical for capitalism she worked with conservatives on political projects but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics rand denounced libertarianism which she associated with anarchism she rejected anarchism as a naive theory based in subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in practice in aesthetics rand defined art as a selective re creation of reality according to an artist s metaphysical value judgments according to her art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be grasped easily thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness as a writer the art form rand focused on most closely was literature she considered romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will rand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her theory of concepts ethics and discovery in politics that evil the violation of rights consists of the initiation of force she believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy stating i am not primarily an advocate of capitalism but of egoism and i am not primarily an advocate of egoism but of reason if one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently all the rest follows criticisms rand s ethics and politics are the most criticized areas of her philosophy numerous authors including robert nozick and william f o neill in some of the earliest academic critiques of her ideas said she failed in her attempt to solve the is ought problem critics have called her definitions of egoism and altruism biased and inconsistent with normal usage critics from religious traditions oppose her rejection of altruism in addition to atheism essays criticizing rand s egoistic views are included in a number of anthologies for teaching introductory ethics which often include no essays presenting or defending them multiple critics including nozick have said her attempt to justify individual rights based on egoism fails others like michael huemer have gone further saying that her support of egoism and her support of individual rights are inconsistent positions some critics like roy childs have said that her opposition to the initiation of force should lead to support of anarchism rather than limited government commentators including hazel barnes albert ellis and nathaniel branden have criticized rand s focus on the importance of reason branden said this emphasis led her to denigrate emotions and create unrealistic expectations of how consistently rational human beings should be relationship to other philosophers except for aristotle thomas aquinas and classical liberals rand was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her acknowledging aristotle as her greatest influence rand remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend three a s aristotle aquinas and ayn rand in a one nine five nine interview with mike wallace when asked where her philosophy came from she responded out of my own mind with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to aristotle the only philosopher who ever influenced me i devised the rest of my philosophy myself in an article for the claremont review of books political scientist charles murray criticized her claim that her only philosophical debt was to aristotle he asserted her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as john locke and friedrich nietzsche rand found early inspiration from nietzsche and scholars have found indications of this in rand s private journals in one nine two eight she alluded to his idea of the superman in notes for an unwritten novel whose protagonist was inspired by the murderer william edward hickman there are other indications of nietzsche s influence in passages from the first edition of we the living which rand later revised and in her overall writing style by the time she wrote the fountainhead rand had turned against nietzsche s ideas and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed rand considered her philosophical opposite to be immanuel kant whom she referred to as the most evil man in mankind s history she believed his epistemology undermined reason and his ethics opposed self interest philosophers george walsh and fred seddon have argued she misinterpreted kant and exaggerated their differences rand s relationship with contemporary philosophers was mostly antagonistic she was not an academic and did not participate in academic discourse she was dismissive toward critics and wrote about ideas she disagreed with in a polemical manner without in depth analysis she was in turn viewed very negatively by many academic philosophers who dismissed her as an unimportant figure who need not be given serious consideration reception and legacy critical reception upright alt photo of rand rand in one nine five seven the first reviews rand received were for night of january one six th reviews of the broadway production were largely positive but rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer although rand believed that her novel we the living was not widely reviewed over two zero zero publications published approximately one two five different reviews overall they were more positive than those she received for her later work her one nine three eight novella anthem received little review attention both for its first publication in england and for subsequent re issues rand s first bestseller the fountainhead received far fewer reviews than we the living and reviewers opinions were mixed lorine pruette s positive review in the new york times was one that rand greatly appreciated pruette called her a writer of great power who wrote brilliantly beautifully and bitterly and said you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time there were other positive reviews but rand dismissed most of them for either misunderstanding her message or for being in unimportant publications some negative reviews focused on the novel s length one called it a whale of a book and another said anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper rationing other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and rand s style offensively pedestrian atlas shrugged was widely reviewed and many of the reviews were strongly negative in national review conservative author whittaker chambers called the book sophomoric and remarkably silly he described the book s tone as shrillness without reprieve he accused rand of supporting a godless system which he related to that of the soviets claiming from almost any page of atlas shrugged a voice can be heard from painful necessity commanding to a gas chamber go atlas shrugged received positive reviews from a few publications including praise from the noted book reviewer john chamberlain rand scholar mimi reisel gladstein later wrote that reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put downs saying it was execrable claptrap written out of hate and showed remorseless hectoring and prolixity rand s nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels the tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book for the new intellectual was similar to that for atlas shrugged philosopher sidney hook likened her certainty to the way philosophy is written in the soviet union and author gore vidal called her viewpoint nearly perfect in its immorality her subsequent books got progressively less review attention on the one zero zero th anniversary of rand s birth in two zero zero five writing for the new york times edward rothstein referred to her written fiction as quaint utopian retro fantasy and programmatic neo romanticism of the misunderstood artist while criticizing her characters isolated rejection of democratic society popular interest upright alt dust jacket from atlas shrugged

congress and the book of the month club in one nine nine one asked club members to name the most influential book in their lives rand s atlas shrugged was the second most popular choice after the bible although rand s influence has been greatest in the united states there has been international interest in her work rand s contemporary admirers included fellow novelists like ira levin kay nolte smith and l neil smith she has influenced later writers like erika holzer and terry goodkind other artists who have cited rand as an important influence on their lives and thought include comic book artist steve ditko and musician neil peart of rush although he later distanced himself rand provided a positive view of business and subsequently many business executives and entrepreneurs have

gaetano rand s works most commonly anthem or the fountainhead are sometimes assigned as secondary school reading since two zero zero two the ayn rand institute has provided free copies of rand s novels to teachers who promise to include the books in their curriculum the institute had distributed four five million copies in the u s and canada by the end of two zero two zero in two zero one seven rand was added to the required reading list for the a level politics exam in the united kingdom political influence although she rejected the labels conservative and libertarian rand has had a continuing influence on right wing politics and libertarianism rand is often considered one of the three most important women along with rose wilder lane and isabel paterson in the early development of modern american libertarianism david nolan one founder of the libertarian party said that without ayn rand the libertarian movement would not exist in his history of that movement journalist brian doherty described her as the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large historian jennifer burns referred to her as the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right the political figures who cite rand as an influence are usually conservatives often members of the republican party despite rand taking some atypical positions for a conservative like being pro choice and an atheist she faced intense opposition from william f buckley jr and other contributors to the conservative national review magazine which published numerous criticisms of her writings and ideas nevertheless a one nine eight seven article in the new york times referred to her as the reagan administration s novelist laureate republican congressmen and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and have recommended her novels she has influenced some conservative politicians outside the u s such as sajid javid in the united kingdom siv jensen in norway and ayelet shaked in israel alt man holding a poster that says i am john galt a protester s sign at a two zero zero nine tea party rally refers to john galt the hero of rand s atlas shrugged the financial crisis of two zero zero seven two zero zero eight spurred renewed interest in her works especially atlas shrugged which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis opinion articles compared real world events with the novel s plot signs mentioning rand and her fictional hero john galt appeared at tea party protests there was increased criticism of her ideas especially from the political left critics blamed the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and free markets particularly through her influence on alan greenspan in two zero one five adam weiner said that through greenspan rand had effectively chucked a ticking time bomb into the boiler room of the us economy lisa duggan said that rand s novels had incalculable impact in encouraging the spread of neoliberal political ideas in two zero two one cass sunstein said rand s ideas could be seen in the tax and regulatory policies of the trump administration which he attributed to the enduring influence of rand s fiction academic reaction during rand s lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars since her death interest in her work has increased gradually in two zero zero nine historian jennifer burns identified three overlapping waves of scholarly interest in rand including an explosion of scholarship since the year two zero zero zero however as of that same year few universities included rand or objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study from two zero zero two to two zero one two over six zero colleges and universities accepted grants from the charitable foundation of bb in some cases the grants were controversial or even rejected because of the requirement to teach about rand in two zero two zero media critic eric burns said that rand is surely the most engaging philosopher of my lifetime but nobody in the academe pays any attention to her neither as an author nor a philosopher that same year the editor of a collection of critical essays about rand said academics who disapproved of her ideas had long held a stubborn resolve to ignore or ridicule her work but he believed more academic critics were engaging with her work in recent years to her ideas in one nine six seven john hospers discussed rand s ethical ideas in the second edition of his textbook an introduction to philosophical analysis that same year hazel barnes included a chapter critiquing objectivism in her book an existentialist ethics when the first full length academic book about rand s philosophy appeared in one nine seven one its author declared writing about rand a treacherous undertaking that could lead to guilt by association for taking her seriously a few articles about rand s ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in one nine eight two many of them in the personalist one of these was on the randian argument by libertarian philosopher robert nozick who criticized her meta ethical arguments other philosophers writing in the same publication argued that nozick misstated rand s case in an article responding to nozick douglas den uyl and douglas b rasmussen defended her positions but described her style as literary hyperbolic and emotional the philosophic thought of ayn rand a one nine eight four collection of essays about objectivism edited by den uyl and rasmussen was the first academic book about rand s ideas published after her death in one essay political writer jack wheeler wrote that despite the incessant bombast and continuous venting of randian rage rand s ethics are a most immense achievement the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought in one nine eight seven allan gotthelf george walsh and david kelley co founded the ayn rand society a group affiliated with the american philosophical association in a one nine nine five entry about rand in contemporary women philosophers jenny a heyl described a divergence in how different academic specialties viewed rand she said that rand s philosophy is regularly omitted from academic philosophy yet throughout literary academia ayn rand is considered a philosopher writing in the one nine nine eight edition of the routledge encyclopedia of philosophy political theorist chandran kukathas summarized the mainstream philosophical reception of her work in two parts he said most commentators view her ethical argument as an unconvincing variant of aristotle s ethics and her political theory is of little interest because it is marred by an ill thought out and unsystematic effort to reconcile her hostility to the state with her rejection of anarchism the journal of ayn rand studies a multidisciplinary peer reviewed academic journal devoted to the study of rand and her ideas was established in one nine nine nine r w bradford stephen d cox and chris matthew sciabarra were its founding co editors in a two zero one zero essay for the cato institute libertarian philosopher michael huemer argued very few people find rand s ideas convincing especially her ethics he attributed the attention she receives to her being a compelling writer especially as a novelist noting that atlas shrugged outsells rand s non fiction works and the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism in two zero one two the pennsylvania state university press agreed to take over publication of the journal of ayn rand studies and the university of pittsburgh press launched an ayn rand society philosophical studies series based on the society s proceedings the fall two zero one two update to the entry about rand in the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy said that only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously that same year political scientist alan wolfe dismissed rand as a nonperson among academics an attitude that writer ben murnane later described as the traditional academic view of rand to her fiction academic consideration of rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited than the discussion of her philosophy mimi reisel gladstein could not find any scholarly articles about rand s novels when she began researching her in one nine seven three and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the one nine seven zero s since her death scholars of english and american literature have continued largely to ignore her work although attention to her literary work has increased since the one nine nine zero s several academic book series about important authors cover rand and her works these include twayne s united states authors ayn rand by james t baker twayne s masterwork studies the fountainhead an american novel by den uyl and atlas shrugged manifesto of the mind by gladstein and re reading the canon feminist interpretations of ayn rand edited by gladstein and sciabarra as well as in popular study guides like cliffsnotes and sparknotes in the literary encyclopedia entry for rand written in two zero zero one john david lewis declared that rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation in two zero one nine lisa duggan

fertile north and the sahara dominating the geography of the south algeria covers an area of making it the world s tenth largest nation by area with a population of four four million algeria is the ninth most populous country in africa and the three two nd most populous country in the world the capital and largest city is algiers located in the far north on the mediterranean coast pre one nine

hammadids almoravids almohads zayyanids spaniards ottomans and finally the french colonial empire the vast majority of algeria s population is arab berber practicing islam and using the official

member name other forms of the name are it is officially the people s democratic republic of algeria abbreviated as radp etymology the country s name derives from the city of algiers which in turn derives from the arabic the islands a truncated form of the older islands of the mazghanna tribe employed by medieval geographers such as al idrisi history prehistory and ancient history around one eight million year old stone artifacts from ain hanech algeria were considered to represent the oldest archaeological materials in north africa stone artifacts and cut marked bones that were excavated from two nearby deposits at ain boucherit are estimated to be one nine million years old and even older stone artifacts to be as old as two four million years hence the ain boucherit evidence shows that ancestral hominins inhabited the mediterranean fringe in northern africa much earlier than previously thought the evidence strongly argues for early dispersal of stone tool manufacture and use from east africa or a possible multiple origin scenario of stone technology in both east and north africa roman ruins at dj mila neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the levalloisian and mousterian styles four three zero zero zero bc similar to those in the levant algeria was the site of the highest state of development of middle paleolithic flake tool techniques tools of this era starting about three zero zero zero zero bc are called aterian after the archaeological site of bir el ater south of tebessa the earliest blade industries in north africa are called iberomaurusian located mainly in the oran region this industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the maghreb between one five zero zero zero and one zero zero zero zero bc neolithic civilization animal domestication and agriculture developed in the saharan and mediterranean maghreb perhaps as early as one one zero zero zero bc or as late as between six zero zero zero and two zero zero zero bc this life richly depicted in the tassili n ajjer paintings predominated in algeria until the classical period the mixture of peoples of north africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called berbers who are the indigenous peoples of northern africa ancient roman ruins of timgad on the street leading to the local arch of trajan from their principal center of power at carthage the carthaginians expanded and established small settlements along the north african coast by six zero zero bc a phoenician presence existed at tipasa east of cherchell hippo regius modern annaba and rusicade modern skikda these settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages as carthaginian power grew its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically berber civilisation was already at a stage in which agriculture manufacturing trade and political organisation supported several states trade links between carthage and the berbers in the interior grew but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others masinissa c two three eight one four eight bc first king of numidia by the early four th century bc berbers formed the single largest element of the carthaginian army in the revolt of the mercenaries berber soldiers rebelled from two four one to two three eight bc after being unpaid following the defeat of carthage in the first punic war they succeeded in obtaining control of much of carthage s north african territory and they minted coins bearing the name libyan used in greek to describe natives of north africa the carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the romans in the punic wars in one four six bc the city of carthage was destroyed as carthaginian power waned the influence of berber leaders in the hinterland grew by the two nd century bc several large but loosely administered berber kingdoms had emerged two of them were established in numidia behind the coastal areas controlled by carthage west of numidia lay mauretania which extended across the moulouya river in modern day morocco to the atlantic ocean the high point of berber civilisation unequalled until the coming of the almohads and almoravids more than a millennium later was reached during the reign of masinissa in the two nd century bc after masinissa s death in one four eight bc the berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times masinissa s line survived until two four ad when the remaining berber territory was annexed to the roman empire the lands which comprise modern day algeria was a part of the byzantine empire the empire in five five five under justinian the great at its greatest extent since the fall of the western roman empire its vassals in pink for several centuries algeria was ruled by the romans who founded many colonies in the region like the rest of north africa algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire exporting cereals and other agricultural products saint augustine was the bishop of hippo regius modern day annaba algeria located in the roman province of africa the germanic vandals of geiseric moved into north africa in four two nine and by four three five controlled coastal numidia they did not make any significant settlement on the land as they were harassed by local tribes in fact by the time the byzantines arrived leptis magna was abandoned and the msellata region was occupied by the indigenous laguatan who had been busy facilitating an amazigh political military and cultural revival furthermore during the rule of the romans byzantines vandals carthaginians and ottomans the berber people were the only or one of the few in north africa who remained independent the berber people were so resistant that even during the muslim conquest of north africa they still had control and possession over their mountains the collapse of the western roman empire led to the establishment of a native kingdom based in altava modern day algeria known as the mauro roman kingdom it was succeeded by another kingdom based in altava the kingdom of altava during the reign of kusaila its territory extended from the region of modern day fez in the west to the western aur s and later kairaouan and the interior of ifriqiya in the east middle ages mansourah mosque tlemcen after negligible resistance from the locals muslim arabs of the umayyad caliphate conquered algeria in the early eight th century dihya memorial in khenchela algeria large numbers of the indigenous berber people converted to islam christians berber and latin speakers remained in the great majority in tunisia until the end of the nine th century and muslims only became a vast majority some time in the one zero th after the fall of the umayyad caliphate numerous local dynasties emerged including the rustamids aghlabids fatimids zirids hammadids almoravids almohads and the abdalwadid the christians left in three waves after the initial conquest in the one zero th century and the one one th the last were evacuated to sicily by the normans and the few remaining died out in the one four th century during the middle ages north africa was home to many great scholars saints and sovereigns including judah ibn quraysh the first grammarian to mention semitic and berber languages the great sufi masters sidi boumediene abu madyan and sidi el houari and the emirs abd al mu min and y ghm rasen it was during this time that the fatimids or children of fatima daughter of muhammad came to the maghreb these fatimids went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the maghreb hejaz and the levant boasting a secular inner government as well as a powerful army and navy made up primarily of arabs and levantines extending from algeria to their capital state of cairo the fatimid caliphate began to collapse when its governors the zirids seceded in order to punish them the fatimids sent the arab banu hilal and banu sulaym against them the resultant war is recounted in the epic t ghrib t in al t ghr b t the amazigh zirid hero kh l f al z nat asks daily for duels to defeat the hilalan hero bu zayd al hilal and many other arab knights in a string of victories the zirids however were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of arab customs and culture the indigenous amazigh tribes however remained largely independent and depending on tribe location and time controlled varying parts of the maghreb at times unifying it as under the fatimids the fatimid islamic state also known as fatimid caliphate made an islamic empire that included north africa sicily palestine jordan lebanon syria egypt the red sea coast of africa tihamah hejaz and yemen caliphates from northern africa traded with the other empires of their time as well as forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other islamic states during the islamic era fatimid caliphate a shia ismaili dynasty that ruled much of north africa c nine six zero one one zero zero the amazighs historically consisted of several tribes the two main branches were the botr and barn s tribes who were divided into tribes and again into sub tribes each region of the maghreb contained several tribes for example sanhadja houara zenata masmouda kutama awarba and berghwata all these tribes made independent territorial decisions several amazigh dynasties emerged during the middle ages in the maghreb and other nearby lands ibn khaldun provides a table summarising the amazigh dynasties of the maghreb region the zirid ifranid maghrawa almoravid hammadid almohad merinid abdalwadid wattasid meknassa and hafsid dynasties both of the hammadid and zirid empires as well as the fatimids established their rule in all of the maghreb countries the zirids ruled land in what is now algeria tunisia morocco libya spain malta and italy the hammadids captured and held important regions such as ouargla constantine sfax susa algiers tripoli and fez establishing their rule in every country in the maghreb region the fatimids which was created and established by the kutama berbers conquered all of north africa as well as sicily and parts of the middle east lands ruled by the ifrenid dynasty of tlemcen current day algeria partially based on the book of ibn khaldun the history of the berbers a few examples of medieval berber dynasties which originated in modern algeria ifranid dynasty maghrawa dynasty zirid dynasty hammadid dynasty fatimid caliphate kingdom of tlemcen map showing territories that were controlled by the zirid dynasty following the berber revolt numerous independent states emerged across the maghreb in algeria the rustamid kingdom was established the rustamid realm stretched from tafilalt in morocco to the nafusa mountains in libya including south central and western tunisia therefore including territory in all of the modern day maghreb countries in the south the rustamid realm expanded to the modern borders of mali and included territory in mauritania once extending their control over all of the maghreb part of spain and briefly over sicily originating from modern algeria the zirids only controlled modern ifriqiya by the one one th century the zirids recognized nominal suzerainty of the fatimid caliphs of cairo el mu izz the zirid ruler decided to end this recognition and declared his independence the zirids also fought against other zenata kingdoms for example the maghrawa a berber dynasty originating from algeria and which at one point was a dominant power in the maghreb ruling over much of morocco and western algeria including fez sijilmasa aghmat oujda most of the sous and draa and reaching as far as m sila and the zab in algeria territories controlled by the maghrawa as the fatimid state was at the time too weak to attempt a direct invasion they found another means of revenge between the nile and the red sea were living bedouin nomad tribes expelled from arabia for their disruption and turbulency the banu hilal and the banu sulaym for example who regularly disrupted farmers in the nile valley since the nomads would often loot their farms the then fatimid vizier decided to destroy what he couldn t control and broke a deal with the chiefs of these beduouin tribes the fatimids even gave them money to leave whole tribes set off with women children elders animals and camping equipment some stopped on the way especially in cyrenaica where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in ifriqiya by the gabes region arriving one zero five one the zirid ruler tried to stop this rising tide but with each encounter the last under the walls of kairouan his troops were defeated and the arabs remained masters of the battlefield they arabs usually didn t take control over the cities instead looting them and destroying them the invasion kept going and in one zero five seven the arabs spread on the high plains of constantine where they encircled the qalaa of banu hammad capital of the hammadid emirate as they had done in kairouan a few decades ago from there they gradually gained the upper algiers and oran plains some of these territories were forcibly taken back by the almohads in the second half of the one two th century the influx of bedouin tribes was a major factor in the linguistic cultural arabization of the maghreb and in the spread of nomadism in areas where agriculture had previously been dominant ibn khaldun noted that the lands ravaged by banu hilal tribes had become completely arid desert the almohads originating from modern day morocco although founded by a man originating from algeria known as abd al mu min would soon take control over the maghreb during the time of the almohad dynasty abd al mu min s tribe the koum a were the main supporters of the throne and the most important body of the empire defeating the weakening almoravid empire and taking control over morocco in one one four seven they pushed into algeria in one one five two taking control over tlemcen oran and algiers wrestling control from the hilian arabs and by the same year they defeated hammadids who controlled eastern algeria following their decisive defeat in the battle of las navas de tolosa in one two one two the almohads began collapsing and in one two three five the governor of modern day western algeria yaghmurasen ibn zyan declared his independence and established the kingdom of tlemcen and the zayyanid dynasty warring with the almohad forces attempting to restore control over algeria for one three years they defeated the almohads in one two four eight after killing their caliph in a successful ambush near oujda the zayyanid kingdom of tlemcen during the rule of abu malek the zayyanids retained their control over algeria for three centuries much of the eastern territories of algeria were under the authority of the hafsid dynasty although the emirate of bejaia encompassing the algerian territories of the hafsids would occasionally be independent from central tunisian control at their peak the zayyanid kingdom included all of morocco as its vassal to the west and in the east reached as far as tunis which they captured during the reign of abu tashfin after several conflicts with local barbary pirates sponsored by the zayyanid sultans spain decided to invade algeria and defeat the native kingdom of tlemcen in one five zero five they invaded and captured mers el k bir and in one five zero nine after a bloody siege they conquered oran following their decisive victories over the algerians in the western coastal areas of algeria the spanish decided to get bolder and invaded more algerian cities in one five one zero they led a series of sieges and attacks taking over bejaia in a large siege and leading a semi successful siege against algiers they also besieged tlemcen in one five one one they took control over cherchell and jijel and attacked mostaganem where although they weren t able to conquer the city they were able to force a tribute on them ottoman era the zayyanid kingdom of tlemcen in the fifteenth century and its neighbors in one five one six the ottoman privateer brothers aruj and hayreddin barbarossa who operated successfully under the hafsids moved their base of operations to algiers they succeeded in conquering jijel and algiers from the spaniards with help from the locals who saw them as liberators from the christians but the brothers eventually assassinated the local noble salim al tumi and took control over the city and the surrounding regions when aruj was killed in one five one eight during his invasion of tlemcen hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of algiers the ottoman sultan gave him the title of beylerbey and a contingent of some two zero zero zero janissaries with the aid of this force and native algerians hayreddin conquered the whole area between constantine and oran although the city of oran remained in spanish hands until one seven nine two hayreddin barbarossa the next beylerbey was hayreddin s son hasan who assumed the position in one five four four he was a kouloughli or of mixed origins as his mother was an algerian mooresse until one five eight seven beylerbeylik of algiers was governed by beylerbeys who served terms with no fixed limits subsequently with the institution of a regular administration governors with the title of pasha ruled for three year terms the pasha was assisted by an autonomous janissary unit known in algeria as the ojaq who were led by an agha discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid one six zero zero s because they were not paid regularly and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha as a result the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in one six five nine plague had repeatedly struck the cities of north africa algiers lost from three zero zero zero zero to five zero zero zero zero inhabitants to the plague in one six two zero two one and suffered high fatalities in one six five four five seven one six six five one six nine one and one seven four zero four two the barbary pirates preyed on christian and other non islamic shipping in the western mediterranean sea the pirates often took the passengers and crew on the ships and sold them or used them as slaves they also did a brisk business in ransoming some of the captives according to robert davis from the one six th to one nine th century pirates captured one million to one two five million europeans as slaves they often made raids called razzias on european coastal towns to capture christian slaves to sell at slave markets in north africa and other parts of the ottoman empire in one five four four for example hayreddin barbarossa captured the island of ischia taking four zero zero zero prisoners and enslaved some nine zero zero zero inhabitants of lipari almost the entire population in one five five one the ottoman governor of algiers turgut reis enslaved the entire population of the maltese island of gozo barbary pirates often attacked the balearic islands the threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of formentera the introduction of broad sail ships from the beginning of the one seven th century allowed them to branch out into the atlantic bombardment of algiers by the anglo dutch fleet to support the ultimatum to release european slaves august one eight one six in july one six two seven two pirate ships from algiers under the command of dutch pirate jan janszoon sailed as far as iceland raiding and capturing slaves two weeks earlier another pirate ship from sal in morocco had also raided in iceland some of the slaves brought to algiers were later ransomed back to iceland but some chose to stay in algeria in one six two nine pirate ships from algeria raided the faroe islands in one six seven one the taifa of raises or the company of corsair captains rebelled killed the agha and placed one of its own in power the new leader received the title of dey after one six eight nine the right to select the dey passed to the divan a council of some sixty nobles it was at first dominated by the ojaq but by the one eight th century it had become the dey s instrument in one seven one zero the dey persuaded the sultan to recognise him and his successors as regent replacing the pasha in that role although algiers remained nominally part of the ottoman empire in reality they acted independently from the rest of the empire and often had wars with other ottoman subjects and territories such as the beylik of tunis the dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat the dey was elected for a life term but in the one five nine years one six seven one one eight three zero that the system was in place fourteen of the twenty nine deys were assassinated despite usurpation military coups and occasional mob rule the day to day operation of the deylikal government was remarkably orderly although the regency patronised the tribal chieftains it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest autonomous tribal states were tolerated and the regency s authority was seldom applied in the kabylia although in one seven three zero the regency was able to take control over the kingdom of kuku in western kabylia many cities in the northern parts of the algerian desert paid taxes to algiers or one of its beys although they otherwise retained complete autonomy from central control while the deeper parts of the sahara were completely independent from algiers kabyle kingdoms at their height christian slaves in algiers one seven zero six barbary raids in the mediterranean continued to attack spanish merchant shipping and as a result the spanish navy bombarded algiers in one seven eight three and one seven eight four for the attack in one seven eight four the spanish fleet was to be joined by ships from such traditional enemies of algiers as naples portugal and the knights of malta over two zero zero zero zero cannonballs were fired much of the city and its fortifications were destroyed and most of the algerian fleet was sunk in one seven nine two algiers took back oran and mers el k bir the two last spanish strongholds in algeria in the same year they conquered the moroccan rif and oujda which they then abandoned in one seven nine five the estimated extent of the regency of algiers in one seven nine two after taking possession of the rif and oujda in the one nine th century algerian pirates forged affiliations with caribbean powers paying a licence tax in exchange for safe harbour of their vessels attacks by algerian pirates on american merchantmen resulted in the first and second barbary wars which ended the attacks on u s ships a year later a combined anglo dutch fleet under the command of lord exmouth bombarded algiers to stop similar attacks on european fishermen these efforts proved successful although algerian piracy would continue until the french conquest in one eight three zero french colonization one eight three

on the french conquest of algeria by one eight seven five the french conquest was complete the war had killed approximately eight two five zero zero zero indigenous algerians since one eight three

stood at about two nine million in one eight seven two reached nearly one one million in one nine six zero french policy was predicated on civilising the country the slave trade and piracy in algeria ceased following the french conquest the conquest of algeria by the french took some time and resulted in considerable bloodshed a combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the indigenous algerian population to decline by nearly one third from one eight three zero to one eight seven two on september one seven one eight six zero napoleon iii declared our first duty is to take care of

whole mediterranean region of algeria as an integral part and d partement of the nation one of france s longest held overseas territories algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of european immigrants who became known as colons and later as pied noirs between one eight two five and one eight four seven five zero zero zero zero french people emigrated to algeria these settlers benefited from the french government s confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land many europeans settled in oran and algiers and by the early two zero th century they formed a majority of the population in both cities the six historical leaders of the fln rabah bitat mostefa ben boula d didouche mourad mohammed boudiaf krim belkacem and larbi ben m hidi during the late one nine th and early two zero th century the european share was almost a fifth of the population the french government aimed at making algeria an assimilated part of france and this included substantial educational investments especially after one nine zero zero the indigenous cultural and religious resistance heavily opposed this tendency but in contrast to the other colonised countries path in central asia and caucasus algeria kept its individual skills and a relatively human capital intensive agriculture during the second world war algeria came under vichy control before being liberated by the allies in operation torch which saw the first large scale deployment of american troops in the north african campaign gradually dissatisfaction among the muslim population which lacked political and economic status under the colonial system gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from france in may one nine four five the uprising against the occupying french forces was suppressed through what is now known as the s tif and guelma massacre tensions between the two population groups came to a head in one nine five four when the first violent events of what was later called the algerian war began after the publication of the declaration of one november one nine

mobs in algeria the fln used hit and run attacks in algeria and france as part of its war and the french conducted severe reprisals the war led to the death of hundreds of thousands of algerians and hundreds of thousands of injuries historians like alistair horne and raymond aron state that the actual number of algerian muslim war dead was far greater than the original fln and official french estimates but was less than the one million deaths claimed by the algerian government after independence horne estimated algerian casualties during the span of eight years to be around seven zero zero
